# RITUAL DATA IN COE4.EXE, PRESENTED AS PSEUDO-MOD CODE
#
# This file contains the ritual data for CoE4, extracted from coe4.exe.  In the
# interest of remaining consistent with the pattern established by Marlin, I
# present the ritual data in the format of a CoE4 mod file.  Of course, this is
# not intended to actually be used as a mod.  Instead, I hope this can serve as
# a useful resource, both for anyone interested in exactly what each ritual
# does, and for modders interested in examples of how to use the available
# commands to build functional rituals.
#
# Interestingly, the rituals in CoE4 are built mostly using the same commands
# available to modders.  There are 8 remaining unknown commands used in the
# ritual data (997, 998, 1000, and 1101-1105).  When they come up, I display
# them as comments, since this is supposed to look like a mod, and I don't have
# names for these commands that the modding engine would recognize.  I don't
# know what the unknown commands do (though I have a fair idea on 997), but
# I've accounted for every ritual command documented in either the modding
# manual or the modding documentation thread or located in the ritual section
# (from address 0xbb2df4 to 0xbb320f) of the command name table in coe4.exe.
# If you think you have an idea what an unknown command represents, please let
# me know.
#
# On the subject of the command name table, I used the order of the commands on
# that table as an aid in identifying many of the less obvious commands.  In so
# doing, it is possible (though I do think it unlikely), that I may have
# misidentified some commands.  If you see anything that looks wrong, please
# let me know, and I'll take a closer look at it.

#
# All of the rituals which summon something do so via strings, with the
# exception of two: Minor Animal Summoning and Major Animal Summoning both
# instead use the specpow command to somehow determine the types and numbers of
# monsters to summon.  I spent my free time for a couple days trying to figure
# out how it works, and got nowhere.  The exact mechanics of these two rituals
# will simply have to remain mysterious for now.
#
# ---
#
# Barring the presence of sum0chance or sum1chance, it appears that all strings
# associated with a summoning ritual are equally likely to be chosen as the
# result of the summons.  I suspect the game simply counts the number of
# strings (or the number remaining after sum0chance and sum1chance) and rolls a
# die of that size to pick which to use.  
#
# When sum0chance is present, I believe it receives a separate d100 roll to see
# whether it triggers, before moving on to sum1chance or the remaining strings.
# In this way, sum0chance should be exactly as likely to succeed as its
# argument says.
#
# sum1chance, on the other hand, is only used when sum0chance has already been
# used in the same ritual.  I believe that sum1chance, too, receives a separate
# d100 roll to see whether it triggers, but that it occurs after the check for
# sum0chance, and only if that check fails.  As a result, sum1chance is
# actually less likely to succeed than its argument suggests.  In keeping with
# basic probability, I believe the actual percentage chance for sum1chance to
# succeed would be modeled correctly by this formula:
#
# (1 - (sum0chance / 100)) * sum1chance
#
# Unfortunately, accurate probabilities for random events are notoriously
# difficult to derive through testing, so we may never know for sure.
# (However, the truth could be determined with a debugger, if anyone wants to
# know badly enough to try.)
#
# One final note on the subject of summoning chances: the ritual Banquet for
# the Dead has sum0chance 50, but only one string, which makes the result of
# casting it somewhat unclear.  In my testing, it appears that sum0chance 50
# has no effect on this ritual; the one string is summoned every time it is
# cast.  I assume there is a safeguard requiring that a ritual have at least
# two strings before sum0chance can take effect, and that this is the reason
# sum0chance is harmless in Banquet for the Dead.  As a side note, the
# inclusion of sum0chance 50 in Banquet for the Dead looks to me like a copy-
# paste error from Grand Blood Feast.
#
# ---
#
# The base chance to control each type of monster summoned by a ritual is
# determined as follows:
#
# 1. If the ritual does not have a defined defctrl, control cannot fail.  This
# causes a bug, by the way; see below.
#
# 2. Otherwise, if the monster has a defined ctrlchance, use that.
#
# 3. Otherwise, use the ritual's defctrl.
#
# For rituals with varcost, the base control chance is further modified by the
# Sacrifice Level used to cast the ritual.  I believe the following formula is
# how final control chance is determined:
#
# base control chance * (resources spent / cost)
#
# For example, with a base control chance of 60% and a cost of 40 sacrifices,
# you could spend 60 sacrifices (1.5 times normal) for a 90% final control
# chance (also 1.5 times normal).
#
# Since Sacrifice Level is capped at 150 (or 1.5 times normal cost), we can
# conclude that 67% is the lowest base control chance that allows for a maximum
# final control chance of 100%.
#
# When a string contains multiple types of monsters, my tests suggest that the
# game rolls only once for control, using the highest final control chance
# among all the monster types.  If the control roll succeeds, all monsters in
# the string will be controlled; if it fails, all will be uncontrolled.
#
# The fact that control cannot fail if the ritual has no defined defctrl causes
# a bug in two of the High Cultist's rituals: Call of the Deep and Ceremony in
# the Deep.  Both can summon a Kraken, which has a defined ctrlchance of 50%,
# and Call of the Deep can summon Shamblers, which have a defined ctrlchance of
# 80%.  Neither can actually ever fail to be controlled when summoned by these
# rituals.  I determined this by testing Call of the Deep until I'd seen 30
# Krakens and countless Shamblers all successfully controlled.  For the Krakens
# alone, this had roughly a 1 in a billion chance to have occurred randomly if
# the intended 50% failure rate for the Kraken was really possible.  However,
# there's actually an easier way to see that these rituals never fail at
# control, which I only noticed after all that testing: when you use one of
# these two rituals, you only get a log message about what was summoned--
# there's no mention of controlling succeeding or failing, presumably because
# there's no check for it.
#

#
# Notably absent from the ritual data are the ceremonies of the Voice of El
# class.  This is actually not terribly surprising, since they break several of
# the rules followed by all rituals, but it is disappointing.  I would have
# liked to know how the ceremonies work, but I don't know where they're located
# or how they're encoded.  I can only say that they don't appear to be recorded
# in the executable in a similar fashion to rituals. 
#
# ---
#
# Also absent from this file are the descriptions of each ritual.  Since these
# are located separately from the ritual data in coe4.exe, I have placed them
# in their own separate file.
#
# ---
#
# The CoE4 modding manual is an incredibly useful source of information, and
# I'd consider it required reading for anyone who wants to mod CoE4, as well as
# a recommended read for anyone who is at all interested in how the game works.
# Without it, this project would not have been possible, or at least not
# reasonable, and I am very grateful to its creators.  That said, in working on
# the ritual data, I have encountered a few discrepancies and omissions from
# the modding manual.
#
# Throughout this file, I have written comments explaining each command, with
# the goal of saving the reader from as much cross-referencing with the modding
# manual as possible.  Many of these comments are copied directly from the
# modding manual, and others are adapted slightly to suit my needs.  However,
# there are a few commands which were absent from the modding manual, or whose
# descriptions there I have found to be incomplete or inaccurate.  In any case
# of conflict between my comments and the modding manual, I have written what I
# believe to be correct.  Of particular note are these commands:
#
# defctrl (with an argument of 997)
# transformtarg
# apcost (with an argument of -1)
# gainbless
# choosefxtarg
# nomonreq
# nomonworldreq
# fxreq
# nofxherereq
# unfollowtarg
# nostart
#
# defctrl 997 is never mentioned in the modding manual; it is a special value
# with three effects: 1. control of summonings cannot fail, 2. log text is
# "raised" instead of "summoned", and 3. sound played is digrydoo.smp
# (didgeridoo) instead of orchhit.smp (summoning).
#
# A ritual with transformtarg is not actually limited to one string; if
# multiple strings are present, one will be randomly selected as the result of
# the transformation.
#
# apcost -1 is never mentioned in the modding manual; it refunds 1 AP to the
# caster.
#
# The modding manual does not show gainbless as taking an argument, implying
# that if the command is used, the effect will always occur.  In fact, it does
# take an argument, which represents the % chance for the gainbless effect to
# occur.  If no argument is used, the default appears to be 0, meaning the
# effect will never occur.
#
# choosefxtarg, fxreq, and nofxherereq all use monster ability ID codes as
# arguments.  Marlin has published the list of these codes, and you can search
# for these commands in this file to see how I describe them (being aware that
# the part after the colon in each case is specific to the monster ability ID
# code that was used).
#
# unfollowtarg does not, as the modding manual suggests, make anyone stop
# following the target.  Rather, it makes the target stop following anyone.
#
# The modding manual states that rituals with nostart can be learned via
# mastery rituals.  In fact, they cannot, and the examples in the ritual data
# are only learned through the gainrit or nexttoo commands.
#
# According to the modding manual's description of nomonreq, the way to have a
# string be used by the nomonreq or nomonworldreq commands is to have that
# string begin with a minus sign.  As we can see in the ritual data, the actual
# syntax is a minus sign enclosed in parentheses.  For example: 
#
# addstring     "-Levy"
#
# will be ignored by nomonreq.  Whereas:
#
# addstring     "(-)Levy"
#
# will be used by nomonreq.
#
# Interestingly, the ritual data also demonstrates another way to use
# parentheses at the beginning of a string which is not mentioned by the
# modding manual.  A string's inclusion can be limited to when the ritual is
# used in a particular terrain by beginning the string with that terrain's
# number enclosed in parentheses.  For example:
#
# addstring     "(117)1d2*Shed"
#
# means that the string will only be included when the ritual is used in a
# Desert (terrain number 117).
#
# This can also be used with negative terrain numbers, making it important to
# note that only a minus sign alone enclosed in parentheses results in a
# nomonreq string; if there are any numbers following the minus sign but still
# within the parentheses, it will be read as a negative terrain number instead.
#
# ---
#
# The ritual Send Lesser Horror appears to have a bug.  It contains this line:
#
# Command-53           0 # Unknown command number -53 with argument 0.
#
# To my knowledge, -53 is meaningless as a command.  However, if it was an
# argument, it would probably represent terrain number -53 (void gateways).
# The preceding ritual, Astrology, has this line:
#
# rebateterr20         -53 # Ritual is 20% cheaper in this terrain: void gateways.
#
# Further, both rituals' descriptions include this sentence: "This ritual is
# easier to perform in locations of power that are tied to the void."  I
# suspect that Send Lesser Horror was also intended to have rebateterr20 on
# terrain -53 (void gateways).
#
# Send Lesser Horror's Command-53 occurs in a section of the ritual's data that
# alternates back and forth between a command ID code and an argument.  It is
# my belief that the command ID code (which was probably supposed to be for
# rebateterr20) was somehow omitted, and -53, which was intended to be an
# argument, was erroneously shifted into the command ID position.
#
# ---
#
# For those interested in how and where the ritual data is encoded in coe4.exe,
# here's a brief explanation.
#
# The ritual data begins at address 0x1807b0 and ends at address 0x2fd92f.
# Each ritual is 0x10f0 bytes long, and there are currently 360 rituals in the
# game.
#
# For each ritual, the first 0x30 bytes are reserved for the ritual's name in
# plain text (in UTF-8 encoding).
#
# The next 0x20 bytes are reserved for commands used frequently enough that the
# developers decided to set aside space for them in every ritual.  Because each
# has a reserved location, no ID code is used to identify these commands--their
# location is their identity.  Rather, only the argument(s) for each is
# recorded, with each argument assigned 4 bytes.  In order, these commands are:
# ritpow, level, cost, cost again (because some rituals require two different
# resources), whether the ritual requires two different resources (0 if no, -1
# if yes), and terr.
#
# The next 0x90 bytes serve as slots for other commands and their arguments.
# There are 9 slots, each consisting of 8 bytes devoted to a command ID code
# followed by 8 bytes for that command's argument.
#
# After that come 8 bytes that are all 00 in every ritual.
#
# Next, there are 4 bytes reserved for bitflags, though only the first 8 bits
# are used.  These flags represent some of the ritual commands that do not
# require an argument.
#
# The next 0x1000 bytes are slots for addstrings.  There are 16 slots, each
# 0x100 bytes long, allowing for a maximum string length of 256 characters.
#
# Finally, there are 4 bytes that are all 00 in every ritual.
#
# ---
#
# Last, some really trivial minutiae: any command that appears to have no
# argument actually has a value of 1 for its argument.  I display them with no
# argument in keeping with the syntax for these commands given in the modding
# manual.  These commands are booleans (i.e. their value is either 1 or 0; true
# or false), and if such a command is used in a mod without specifying its
# argument, the game assumes a value of 1.  When such a command is used in the
# executable, the argument of 1 is explicitly stated, not merely assumed, but I
# am trying to present this as a pseudo-mod, hence my decision to follow the
# modding manual's syntax.
