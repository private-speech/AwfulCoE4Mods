# BUILT‚ÄêIN WEAPON DEFINITIONS IN COE4.EXE, EXPRESSED AS PSEUDO-MOD CODE
# (Unknown data, or data for which mod commands are missing,
# given in comments.)
#
# Specifically, for the weapon definitions, I believe the only thing missing
# is the possibility to provide the command "next", for an extra weapon effect,
# with an argument. In mods, no argument is accepted with that command, and it
# will implicitly and always refer to the next weapon definition in the mod.
# The extra effect will be applied IF THE TARGET IS AFFECTED, only.
#
# In the executable, the extra effect of a weapon is given as an index of any
# other weapon. Furthermore, if that index is negated (with a minus),
# the extra effect will be delivered already ONCE THE TARGET IS HIT
# (no requirement that it is affected).
#
# In this file, where the extra effect happens to refer to the next weapon
# definition, and a positive number is given for index, the real mod command
# next is used (with no argument). Otherwise, a commented version of next
# with argument is used.
