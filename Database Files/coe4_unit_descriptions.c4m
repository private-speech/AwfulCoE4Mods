selectmonster "Deer"
descr "This impressive looking beast has sharp teeth, large antlers and a sinister mind.  Many hunters have tried to chase a lone Deer through a forest only to find themselves surrounded by an entire herd.  This never ends well, because the Deer is a very fast creature and it shows no mercy to its prey.  Even though Deer are aggressive when they are hungry, they are also very clever and seldom attack armed men unless they outnumber their prey.  Contrary to what many people believe, Deer do not need to eat humans, but can survive entirely on forest berries and mushrooms."

selectmonster "Moose"
descr "The Moose is an immense beast that is considered to be the king of the forest by those who have not heard of the Beholder yet.  The Moose has an enormous appetite and eats entire trees, so if you see a tree stump in the middle of a forest you can be certain there is a Moose nearby.  The Moose is not as aggressive as its smaller cousin the Deer, but you should still be careful.  If there are no tasty trees nearby, the Moose will not hesitate to satisfy its hunger by eating a human instead."

selectmonster "Giant Moose"
descr "An ordinary Moose is huge, but this Moose makes the ordinary Moose look like a horned dog.  The Giant Moose is immense and can be seen towering over the trees.  When hungry, it can eat a small forest and when it moves its giant strides take it forward more quickly than anyone can follow."

selectmonster "Bear"
descr "The Bear may not be very bright, but it is larger and stronger than most other creatures and gets along very well with all the other beasts.  The Bear likes potatoes more than anything, so if you encounter a Bear, it is good to have a potato to throw in the direction you are not running to.  It has happened many times that a group of Deer joins forces with a number of Bears in order to attack a fortified town.  The Deer then have the strong Bears break down the gates.  The surviving people have returned later only to find half eaten corpses on the streets and all the potato stashes plundered by the Bears.  During the winter the Bear spends most of its time napping and will not bother anyone who is wise enough to stay away."

selectmonster "Serpent"
descr "Smartest among the beasts, the Serpent is not one to be trifled with.  It is an excellent climber despite being larger than a human and it likes to hide up in the trees.  From there it can ambush unsuspecting humans when they come close and the Serpent's venomous bite makes sure that anyone bitten will not survive for long.  The Serpent only hunts during the warm seasons.  When it gets cold, it becomes sluggish and only kills those stupid enough to walk straight into its mouth."

selectmonster "Snake"  # also "Snake Familiar"
descr "Much smaller than the Serpent, the Snake is easy to hold at bay for an armed soldier.  However, it is important not to get bitten, because its poison is even more potent than that of the much larger serpent.  Despite its small size, the Snake is still cunning and dangerous.  Snakes often attack weakly guarded towns during the night when they can crawl over the walls unseen.  Once inside, they will try to bite a few humans to feast on after the luckier part of the town population has managed to escape."

selectmonster "Giant Spider"
descr "Venomous fangs, skin as hard as stone and a multitude of eyes and legs makes the giant spider very frightening.  It is so scary that even other beasts are afraid of it, which makes the giant spider sad.  The bear doesn't seem to mind, though, and often shares its lair with the giant spider.  You should not feel sorry for the spider, however, because it attacks on sight and it is as deadly as it looks.  Hiding behind a city wall will not work either, because the giant spider can run up any wall with ease."

selectmonster "Large Spider"
descr "It may look as large as a Giant Spider, but the Large Spider is mostly long legs and not much body.  Even though it is a bit smaller and not quite as venomous as its larger cousin, it compensates for this by being even meaner.  It likes to trap humans in its web and let a few drops of poison kill them slowly.  It then watches their agonies with its many eyes and skitters around in anticipation.  Just like most many-legged beasts, the Large Spider is an excellent climber and can scale any surface."

selectmonster "Small Spider"
descr "While much smaller than the giant type of spiders, it is still rather large for a spider.  It is capable of biting a human and its poisonous bite can even be lethal."

selectmonster "Scorpion"
descr "The Scorpion is small enough to kill by stepping on it.  But you should be careful, because it is faster than it looks and the sting can be deadly for even a fully grown human being."

selectmonster "Boar"  # also "Great Boar", "Monster Boar"
descr "The Boar is not a nice beast.  It roams the plains and woodlands of Elysium and bullies other wildlife.  Boars often raid farms and small settlements in their constant hunt for truffles and rotten turnips.  The Boar has a foul temper and will enter a furious rage should anyone stand up to its bullying or try to hinder its quest for food."

selectmonster "Elephant"  # also "War Elephant"
descr "The Elephant is one of the friendlier beasts and it never attacks when it is not hungry.  Of course, its huge size makes it consume a massive amount of food, but the Elephant likes to show its friendly nature by moving around slowly and thus conserving its energy.  When hunting, the Elephant rushes forward at a surprisingly fast speed and tramples its prey to death properly before devouring it in a single bite."

selectmonster "Giant Ant Queen"
descr "The giant ant colonies are at their most vulnerable when the queen emerges all by herself to wander off and establish a new colony.  If the queen is allowed to establish a new colony, armies of giant ants will start to appear soon afterwards and destroy everything nearby.  The law says that any armed man seeing an Ant Queen must attack her at once or bring more armed warriors if necessary and then attack.  The law also states that no more than 1 hour must pass between seeing the queen and a successful attack."

selectmonster "Giant Ant"
descr "Giant Ants can be a serious problem for people living in both villages and towns.  The thick armor on the ant makes it almost impossible to harm with normal bows and you need a large number of heavy crossbows to deal with one of these creatures.  City walls do not help either, because the Giant Ant does not seem to care if it is standing on flat ground or climbing a vertical wall.  The Giant Ant attacks by biting with its large mandibles or by spraying a potent acid on its victims.  Once inside a town, the Giant Ants will take as much food as they can and then wander off with it."

selectmonster "Fire Ant"
descr "Event though they are much larger than ordinary ants, the Fire Ants are not much more intelligent.  They just wander around in a constant search for more food and attack everything that comes in their path.  They eat just about anything, such as fruit, leaves, dead animals or any living thing that doesn't run away fast enough.  This makes sure that even by walking around at random, they can be successful at finding food."

selectmonster "Giant Mantis"
descr "Enormous eyes, long antennas and spiked arms that shoot out with lightning speed give the Giant Mantis an otherworldly appearance.  Many people have thought it to be a demon of some kind, but it is just an ordinary large and mean beast.  The Giant Mantis can be found in most places of Elysium, but it seems to like the plains and savannas the most."

selectmonster "Wolf"
descr "Even though it is smaller than most of the other beasts, the Wolf is still strong and has sharp teeth that make it deadly in combat.  The Wolf mostly hunts at night and attacks anyone foolish enough to sleep in the wilds without a sufficient number of guards keeping watch.  When travelling in the northern territories, people are taught to avoid the Deer during the day and to look strong during the night to keep the Wolves from attacking."

selectmonster "Winter Wolf"
descr "Empowered by elemental forces, the Winter Wolf is much deadlier than the ordinary Wolf, even though they are about the same size. The Winter Wolf can breathe a cold mist over a large area and the mist will kill most ordinary soldiers.  This cold loving wolf can sometimes be found in the most northern parts of Elysium, where the snow never melts."

selectmonster "Giant Crab"
descr "The Giant Crab likes to wander along the coast in its search for rotten fish.  The reason why fishermen don't throw the fish remains in the sea is that the Giant Crabs hunger for rotten fish.  Once a Giant Crab has discovered it can find fish remains close to a village, it is likely to return and eventually it will find the village and raid it in search for more food.  Trying to fight off a Giant Crab is usually pointless, because its very thick armor makes it very difficult to harm with normal weapons and the crab's claw is powerful enough to snap a human clean in two."

selectmonster "Sacred Moose"
descr "The white moose, king of the beasts, what a magnificent animal.  Its splendor is so great that it would be impossible to willingly hurt this most magnificent beast.  If it tries to feed on you, it would be best to remain still so that you don't disturb it when it is eating.  However, the Sacred Moose has the same weakness as the Unicorn, namely that it likes young girls.  So to kill a Sacred Moose, you should to distract it with a young girl and then strike it in the back before you realize how magnificent it is."

selectmonster "Cockatrice"
descr "A strange crossbreed of a rooster and a wyvern, the Cockatrice is much deadlier than the two of these ordinary beasts together.  The Cockatrice will petrify any living or at least remotely living thing just by looking at it.  You do not want to fight this monster and you probably don't want it fighting with you either, because it is not very particular about where it looks."

selectmonster "Lion"
descr "The Lion enjoys the desert and it will spend most days dozing off on top of a huge sand dune, so that it can be seen from far away and spread fear among its prey.  During the night it will begin to wander and search for prey far away, because there usually isn't any clever food nearby."

selectmonster "Leogryph"
descr "Part Gryphon, part Lion, the Leogryph is a strange sight to behold.  It has the Gryphon's love of high mountains and builds its nest there.  Unfortunately, the Lion part gave it the inability to fly and the inability to climb mountains properly."

selectmonster "Tiger"
descr "The Tiger is a very formidable foe.  It is almost as large as a Lion and twice as courageous.  The Tiger likes jungles where it roams around at night, attacking anything short of a large army that it finds."

selectmonster "Lobster"
descr "Large, well armored and with a powerful claw, a fully grown Lobster is not something you want to fight with.  Luckily the Lobster never leaves the sea and is only likely to bother the occasional unfortunate fisherman.  Should a fortunate human manage to kill a Lobster, it can be made to an excellent soup and its flesh grilled with herb butter also tastes divine."

selectmonster "Small Shark"
descr "Sharks can grow very large and when they are fully grown they are much too large to be caught by a fisherman.  However, they can still be caught while small and they make for a delicious soup."

selectmonster "Great Shark"
descr "Sharks can grow very large and when they are fully grown they are much too large to be caught by a fisherman.  In fact, the fishermen always try to stay far away from the great sharks, who are known to enjoy attacking small boats and devouring the people in them."

selectmonster "Asp Turtle"
descr "Asp Turtles are the rulers of the sea, because no one would dare attack one of these majestic creatures.  They swim around eating sea weed and whatever else happens to come too close.  Luckily for the people of Elysium, the Asp Turtle never leaves the sea and thus seldom bothers anyone."

selectmonster "Monster Fish"  # also "Monster of the Deep"
descr "This hideous fish is truly huge and it can swallow a great shark in a single bite.  The Monster Fish likes to hunt in the deepest parts of the ocean where it can attract whatever is down there with its shining lure-light."

selectmonster "Hippocampus"
descr "Life underneath the waves corresponds in many ways to that on dry land.  The Hippocampus is an aquatic variety of the ordinary land Unicorn."

selectmonster "Sea Stag"
descr "Life underneath the waves corresponds in many ways to that on dry land.  The Sea Stag is a great aquatic stag with a fish tail instead of hindquarters."

selectmonster "Sea Dog"
descr "The Sea Dog may look like a friendly dog with blue fur, but its nature is that of a bloodthirsty beast.  Sea Dogs are usually found in the sea, but when hungry they enter the coastal regions and hunt for food.  They can even attack settlements that are not well fortified and kill a few villagers to satisfy their hunger."

selectmonster "Leocampus"
descr "Half lion and half fish, the Leocampus is a strange creature.  It has inherited the laziness of the Lion and the tastiness of a cod.  Usually tasty fishes don't lie lazily on the seabed waiting for someone to eat them, but the Leocampus does.  This makes it the favorite target for many large sea monsters."

selectmonster "Giant Jellyfish"
descr "The Giant Jellyfish are rarely seen by humans, because they usually float around in the deepest seas at the edges of the Void. They float around there because they like to eat Horrors and they are seemingly unaffected by the Void, probably due to their horrorlike appearance.  The Jellyfish should be seen as an important ally to humankind, because they help keep down the number of Horrors in the world.  Still, it is best to leave them alone as they are not very picky about what they eat."

selectmonster "Kraken"
descr "The Kraken is the most intelligent of all the sea creatures and it has shown a strange attraction to astral magic.  More than once an astrologer has been surprised to find a huge kraken climb his tower walls, drawn by the astrological experiments.  When the Kraken comes, it is important to have a magic trinket to throw away, because Krakens love magic trinkets and it should keep it occupied long enough to escape."

selectmonster "Dragonfly"
descr "Quite large for a Dragonfly, it may even be dangerous in large numbers."

selectmonster "Beetle"
descr "A large beetle that makes an annoying sound when it flies and getting bit by it really hurts."

selectmonster "Goat"
descr "A single Goat is a cowardly and sometimes even friendly animal.  Some farmers keep a few captured Goats and use them to get goat milk. It is important to never let the Goats gather in numbers, because in a group they are much braver and could gang up on their captor.  That's why farmers seldom have more than three Goats, which seems to be a number that keeps them sufficiently cowed."

selectmonster "Rabbit"  # also "Rabbit Familiar"
descr "Small white and fluffy, the Rabbit does not look very dangerous.  Those sharp front teeth are not there for show, however, and being bit by the Rabbit can hurt really bad."

selectmonster "Murder of Crows"
descr "One Crow may be harmless, but these aggressive birds are many and may give even a seasoned warrior a decent fight."

selectmonster "Messenger Crows"
descr "Crows are many and they have sharp eyes.  This makes them excellent scouts for those who can command them."

selectmonster "Wyvern"
descr "Being smaller and less dangerous than a real Dragon, these much smaller flying beasts seem to have developed a very foul temper.  The Wyvern will fly around in the mountains and attack anyone that does not pose a threat to it, just because it can.  It is said to enjoy eating female Hoburghers most of all, so small people should be extra wary when travelling in the mountains.  Even though it is not a Dragon, the Wyvern is still dangerous, because it has a deadly poisonous stinger."

selectmonster "Amphiptere"
descr "The Amphiptere is the most noble of all the Serpents in Elysium.  It has wings on its back and likes to fly above the forests so that all the lesser beasts can look upon it and admire its grace.  It is not as smart or patient as normal Serpents and never lies in ambush.  It prefers to fly and spit poison on whatever fleeing food it can find."

selectmonster "Horse"
descr "Horses were brought into Elysium from abroad, which may explain their friendly behavior.  Most Horses have human masters and willingly help as steeds or with the plow.  The few Horses that escape into the wild usually don't last long among the more devious beasts."

selectmonster "Donkey"
descr "Donkeys were brought into Elysium from abroad, which may explain their friendly behavior.  Most Donkeys have human masters and willingly help as beasts of burden. The few Donkeys that escape into the wild usually don't last long among the more devious beasts."

selectmonster "Chimaera"
descr "This large beast has the body and head of a Lion, the tail of a Snake, the wings of a Bat and then an extra Goat head on top of that.  The Goat head may not look very useful, but it is has very good vision and is always on the lookout, afraid that something is going to eat it.  As soon as something approaches, the Goat will scream and the Lion part will wake up and attack."

selectmonster "Gryphon"
descr "The Gryphon is a mythical beast, part Lion, part Eagle.  It nests in remote mountains and likes to collects gems."

selectmonster "Roc"
descr "The Roc is like a Giant Eagle, but much larger.  It is large enough to grab a Bear an fly away with it, should it want to.  But the Bears and Rocs seem to get along quite nicely, so it is more likely to grab huge boulders and drop them on fortified human settlements."

selectmonster "Eye Tyrant"  # also "Elder Beholder", "Beholder"
descr "This floating being is highly intelligent and likes to makes its lair in ancient forests where the power lines flow strongly or in deep mines where there is plenty of gold and gems.  The Beholder often surrounds itself with enslaved guards from races stupid enough not to flee it in time.  Other than floating over power lines, it is believed that the Beholder likes gold much like Dragons.  Like Dragons, it also enjoys eating both Deer and Dwarves when it gets hungry.  In practice it is probably mostly Dwarves, because it will get less hungry when it is floating over the power lines in an ancient forest."

selectmonster "Dog"  # also "War Dog"
descr "Dogs were brought into Elysium by the first men and they are still quite friendly towards humans.  If raised from a puppy, a Dog can usually be trained to do useful things like hunting or guarding."

selectmonster "Elder Druid"
descr "The Elder Druid has mastered the way of controlling nature and the beasts that live in the wilds.  Through the ancient forests his power can influence the entire continent and powerful beasts that have not been seen in ages can be summoned.  The power of the nature is great enough, that the Elder Druid should not have much trouble bringing the entire Elysium under his rule once all of the wilds are under his command."

selectmonster "Druid"  # also "Druid's Apprentice"
descr "The Druids like to portray themselves as priests of nature and the saviors of Elysium.  Most people do not agree with this description, but what is certain is that they have found a way to coerce the beasts of Elysium to do their bidding.  However, meddling with the forces of nature is dangerous and it is only a matter of time before the Druid is lured into helping the beasts in their war against humankind.  When such beasts attack human settlements, they are backed by the power of the Druid.  Helping the beasts is surely an act of evil, but no one can deny that leading the animals is a great feat of magic as the beasts of Elysium have strong souls and are not easily swayed."

selectmonster "Monkey"
descr "Monkeys are the Hoburghers of the Apes.  They are small, weak and not quite as smart or civilized as the real Apes.  Monkeys are often bullied by the Apes and they tend to stay away from them if possible.  If left to themselves, the Monkeys enjoy eating sweet jungle fruits and climbing trees."

selectmonster "Ape"  # also "Great Ape"
descr "While the small Monkeys are mostly harmless, the real Apes are most definitely not.  The Apes are large and strong and will find and attack any humans that come close to their territory.  Although excellent tree climbers, the Apes prefer to stay on the ground because that is where most of their prey is."

selectmonster "Camel"
descr "The Camel is a desert dwelling beast that enjoys standing still in the sun and eating cactuses.  If it weren't for the Camels, the desert would be full of cactuses, much like a forest.  Although not very aggressive, you should stay well away from a Camel as it has both a fierce bite and a powerful kick that it gladly uses on anyone nearby."

selectmonster "Horned God"
descr "Not a very powerful god, because it is mostly worshipped by lowly beasts.  The fact the it has horns resembling those of a Giant Deer makes it likely that it is in fact a Deer that has attained godhood in ancient times when the beasts were smart enough to engage in proper worship.  Even though it is probably just an overgrown Deer, the fact that it is a minor god still makes it quite powerful when compared to mortals."

selectmonster "Forest Shepherd"
descr "The forests have not always been in the places where they currently are.  Sometimes they have to move because some god wants it that way and then it is time for the Forest Shepherds to do their work.  The Forest Shepherds make sure the trees move and that they move in the right directing.  Trees move very slowly so keeping the trees from going astray is easy.  The only difficult part is the amount of patience required for this job."

selectmonster "Vergobret"
descr "Occasionally the druid appoint a person the be a leader of humans with the right to punish anyone who disobeys his orders. This does not allow Vergobrets to punish Druids obviously, you cannot punish those who have appointed you."

selectmonster "Barechested Scout"
descr "Every army should have a scout in it. The scout will sneak around in the surrounds areas and discover hidden enemies before the army gets ambushed."

selectmonster "Barechested Warrior"  # also "Barechested Slinger", "Barechested Swordsman", "Hornblower"
descr "The barechested warriors are not as civilized as ordinary men. They believe their sparse use of clothing gives them a stronger connection to nature and lets the inherit the battle ferocity of the beasts. This is only superstition however and they would hardly stand a chance against a proper army of civilized men."

selectmonster "Chieftain"
descr "The strongest among the warriors is the chieftain and he wears proper armor to remind the others of this fact. Everyone near him will be sure to fight at their best, because they know the chieftain will beat them up otherwise."

selectmonster "Beast Cavalry"
descr "The beast cavalry was intended to be the wildest and most fearsome cavalry of Elysium, with barechested men charging on great moose and bears or at least a ferocious deer. Unfortunately the catching and trying to ride beasts cost too many lives with nothing to show for it, despite having this seemingly great connection to nature. So now it is horses and proper armor instead. Not as awe inspiring as first intended, but they are still called the beast cavalry and claim they will start riding wild beasts any day now."

selectmonster "Boar Warrior"
descr "The Boar Warriors have skipped the barechest thing and put on some proper armor instead. Despite this they seem to gotten their connection to nature right. The easily lose their mind in battle and just go berserk, although not a great battle strategy it seems to be just in line with the less intelligent beasts."

selectmonster "Sea Dragon"
descr "Sea Dragons are actually more like turtles than dragons. They like to swim, they eat seaweed and they don't breathe fire. One thing they do have in common with dragons is that they like shiny trinkets, so fishermen need to stay away. When a sea dragon sees a boat it will always attack and then search the wreck for shiny things."

selectmonster "Winged Monkey"
descr "Winged Monkeys are the creations of some twisted magic. What use could anyone possibly have for a dumb flying monkey that can make people sleep."

selectmonster "Ent"
descr "The Ent is an old tree that has come alive and now it is capable of killing people with its many branches. Anyone that has tried to kill a normal tree knows it takes axes, timber saws and a lot of time to make it. Killing one that can strike back should not be attempted without the use of magic."

selectmonster "Rat"
descr "Rats thrive in human settlements where scraps of food can be stolen by a quick and resourceful animal.  The rat is a cowardly and dishonorable beast, it is not brave enough to take a fight against the humans, yet it sneaks around and steals food wherever it is left unguarded."

selectmonster "Giant Rat"
descr "Being much larger than an ordinary rat, the giant rat has a much harder time sneaking around in human settlements without attracting the city guard.  The giant rat is more often found in places that have been abandoned by humans where it eats anything left behind, it can even dig up rotting corpses to eat if it is hungry."

selectmonster "Witch Doctor"  # also "Hyena Tribe Warrior"
descr "The tribal men of the southern savannas claim to be blessed by the Spirit of the Hyena.  However, few of their neighbors consider the blessing of the Hyena something to strive for.  Despised by all, they share their patron spirit's gruesome appetites and hunt and feed on human flesh.  Their diet has changed their nature and they have lost much of their humanity."

selectmonster "Tribal Queen"  # also "Lion King", "Lion Tribe Warrior"
descr "The tribal men of the south claim to be blessed by the Lion Spirit.  They live in small settlements in the dense rain forests of the south and rarely venture far from their homes, unless to wage war on their ancestral enemies, the Hyena Tribes.  They are sometimes led by sorceror queens."

selectmonster "Pygmy"
descr "The Pygmies are like small humans that live in jungles.  Despite being very small they are still dangerous in combat because they use poisoned arrows to bring down their foes."

selectmonster "Venus Trap"
descr "The Venus Trap is a dangerous flower that will try to devour anyone that comes within reach.  It blends well into the surrounding vegetation and if you are not careful, you may walk straight into a patch of these flowers and not notice until it is too late."

selectmonster "Death Fungus"
descr "A huge Death Fungus growing on the grave of a loved one is seen as a good omen and means that the deceased one has gone to his final resting place.  The Death Fungus is one of the reasons you don't build a graveyard close to populated areas, because it spreads spores that are extremely deadly.  Anyone hit by the spores will start to wither and joins the rest of the corpses in a matter of minutes.  The Death Fungus can spread very quickly once it has started to grow in a graveyard and it will quickly make the graveyard unusable for human beings.  The positive side is that the fungus will consume the corpses and make sure they cannot rise as undead."

selectmonster "Devil Fungus"
descr "The Devil's Luck or Devil Fungus for short is a huge fungus that will emit a cloud of highly poisonous spores as soon as anyone comes nearby.  From a distance the fungus looks like an exceedingly large and tasty mushroom that will provide a lucky mushroom gatherer with food for months.  However, when a gatherer gets close he is likely to be killed by the poisonous spores and it will be said he had the devil's luck in finding this mushroom."

selectmonster "Snow Fungus"
descr "The Snow Fungus only grows in the cold northern parts of Elysium.  The fungus is often covered in snow which makes it very difficult to see.  Usually it is not discovered until it emits a cloud of poisonous spores because someone moved too close to a suspicious looking mound of snow."

selectmonster "Blood Fungus"
descr "The huge Blood Fungus can be difficult to spot in the forest despite its blood red color and many hunters have been struck by its poisonous spores after walking too close to the fungus.  The Blood Fungus shoots out a very large cloud of spores, but luckily these spores are not quite as poisonous as many of the other giant fungi produces."

selectmonster "Blue Giant"
descr "When someone gets close to this giant fungus, it will shoot out a cloud of magic spores that puts the person asleep and slowly poisons him to death.  It is said to be a very pleasant way to die.  Fortunately the Blue Giant is an enormously large fungus and it is also has a very clear blue color, which makes it almost impossible to walk close to it by mistake."

selectmonster "Giant Mushroom"
descr "When someone gets close to this giant fungus, it will shoot out a cloud of poisonous spores that slowly kill the victim.  Fortunately the Giant Mushroom is an enormously large fungus and it is also very colorful, which makes it almost impossible to walk close to it by mistake."

selectmonster "Heart of the Forest"
descr "The Heart of the Forest is the oldest and most respected tree in the forest.  Other trees will bow to the wisdom of this tree and by controlling the Heart a Druid will in time gain control over the surrounding forest as well.  In combat the Heart of the Forest can cast spells to defend itself and the forest."

selectmonster "Woodman"
descr "Woodmen are difficult to spot, but they live in all older forests.  When encountered, the Woodmen can often be seen shambling about and collecting fallen twigs and pine cones.  It is believed that the Woodsmen are what prevents the forests from eventually filling up with fallen debris from the trees."

selectmonster "Ichtyid Raider"  # also "Ichtyid Warrior", "Ichtyid Captain"
descr "Ichtyids are large fish beings with legs and arms that makes them able to operate on land.  They have the strength and size of a fish, but despite this they are not quite as stupid as a normal fish and are able to utilize tools and weapons.  Ichtyids often raid fishing villages and try to steal all the tools and supplies they can get hold of.  The raiders are not easy to kill, but the reward for killing them is not bad either.  A smoked Ichtyid is a real treat and is large enough for a small village to feast on."

selectmonster "Bishop Fish"
descr "Apparently the fishes also have an organized religion in order to worship their fish god in the proper way.  The Bishop Fish is the proof of this and it acts like the fish god's representative in Elysium, freeing up the busy fish god to deal with more important matters."

selectmonster "Triton"  # also "Triton Trooper", "Triton King"
descr "The Tritons are almost human in appearance, but they have a fishlike skin and their legs end in fins.  It is likely that the first of this race were human fishermen who were unlucky enough to anger some fish god.  The fish god then cursed the fishermen to live forever under the surface and thus the Tritons were born."

selectmonster "Hedge Wizard"
descr "The wizards who have learned some kind of magic on their own, or perhaps from another untrained mage, are called Hedge Wizards.  Their control of magic is rudimentary at best as they lack all the theoretical knowledge needed to master the art.  The magic of the Hedge Wizards is often tainted by the influences of Nature and the spells they manage to learn are usually limited to what Nature can influence."

selectmonster "Archmage"
descr "The Archmage is the eternal headmaster of the Academy of Higher Magic and Elemental Powers.  The Archmage is a position appointed for life and the Archmages have all been highly skilled at magic and tend to live for a very long time.  In addition to bad hearing, very old age for mages comes with the more serious problem of madness.  The reign of the previous Archmage, Gustafus, ended spectacularly after he was convinced horrors had infiltrated the Academy and then blasted it to rubble with a mighty ritual."

selectmonster "Pyromancer"  # also "Adept of Pyriphlegeton"
descr "The Pyromancer is a modern mage who has studied the theoretical aspects of fire and the ways to master this elemental force with magic.  The power of the fully trained Pyromancer is formidable and a single one can turn the tide of a huge battle.  The Pyromancers should be treated with respect, since their contribution to keeping the wildlife at bay is of utmost importance."

selectmonster "Animist"  # also "Master Animist"
descr "The Animist is an expert on the theory of Nature and the beasts that live there.  Most mages will find that Nature tries to stop them, but the Animist can use his magic and expertise to make the very Nature help him instead.  The Animist is an important ally against both the enemies of the Empire as well as against the beasts."

selectmonster "Old Wizard"
descr "Most wizards die young from failed experiments or ambushes while traveling between the libraries, but if they manage to stay alive they become wise and powerful.  Some Old Wizards have been known to wipe out entire armies all by themselves and they can be extremely valuable to any ruler.  While old age brings wisdom and power, it also brings bad hearing, near blindness and the general madness of old people."

selectmonster "Dark Wizard"  # also "Master of Darkness"
descr "The Dark Wizard has learned the theory behind darkness, shadows and the ether that connects our world to the world of the dead.  The Dark Wizard can use this knowledge to call upon the Shadows that live in between worlds and to send terror into mortals."

selectmonster "Sorceress"  # also "Great Sorceress"
descr "Through long and hard studies the Sorceress has learned almost everything about the skies and the stars therein.  Now she is able to summon lightning from the firmament or tell the future by reading the stars."

selectmonster "Black Sorceress"  # also "Mother Superior"
descr "Beware of the Black Sorceress, for she has studied the forbidden black arts and gained great power.  However, the process has taken its toll and her sanity and her temper may not be what they once were."

selectmonster "White Wizard"  # also "Grand Wizard"
descr "The Order of the White Wizards is the defender of Elysium against the Infernal forces and the spirits of the dead.  The White Wizards excel at defeating evil and foreseeing major evil events and it is only with their help that Elysium will be able to keep these forces at bay."

selectmonster "Golden Wizard"  # also "Master Arch Wizard"
descr "The Order of the Golden Wizards is a newly founded order that proclaims to be the bringers of justice and the scourge of evil.  Their justice seems quite arbitrary, but they don't mind bringing it to someone if you can pay for it.  The order is effective at blasting enemies, so they could probably be a good scourge of evil if someone should pay them for it."

selectmonster "Moon Mage"  # also "Moon Master"
descr "The initiates of this order have to spend every hour of the night for their first year staring at the moon.  This give them the necessary understanding of the moon and also makes sure they are not susceptible to be driven mad, a common fate of Moon Mages.  The mages of this order draw their powers from the moon and can put enemies asleep or drive them mad if they wish."

selectmonster "Astrologer"  # also "High Astrologer"
descr "Everything that has happened or will happen is written in the stars and by influencing the stars we can influence the reality of the world.  That is at least what the astrologers want people to believe, yet they seem completely unable to make an accurate foretelling of tomorrow's weather or change it to a less rainy one.  Considering the time they spend looking at the sky, you should think that foretelling the weather should be the easiest task possible for them."

selectmonster "Ice Druid"  # also "Frost Father"
descr "The Order of the Ice Druids is located as far north as you can go, in lands where the ice never melts.  The Ice Druids or snow herders as they are also known used to be responsible for finding food for the animals and helping old people when the winter was harsh.  After coming to Elysium they instead focus on not letting the beasts kill too many people when winter comes."

selectmonster "Sea Father"  # also "Grandfather of the Sea"
descr "The Sea Fathers have devoted their life to the study of the sea.  It is believed that their founder thought that the sea was best studied in the sea and far below the surface, because all members of the order must learn how to breathe under water.  In fact, the rite of acceptance for becoming a full Sea Father requires the subject to spend an entire day underwater without drowning.  Nowadays the order has evolved and it is known that the seas are best studied from a library on dry land where you can read insightful books and where you aren't distracted by the annoyingly cold water."

selectmonster "Green Enchantress"  # also "High Enchantress"
descr "The Order of the Green Enchantresses consists of only beautiful young girls dressed in green.  Their strong connection to the wild Nature gives them magic powers and some says it also keeps them young forever.  The truth is probably that you don't live long if you try to have a connection with Nature in Elysium."

selectmonster "Scarlet Sister"  # also "Scarlet Mother"
descr "The Scarlet Sisterhood consists of female wizards with a wide variety of talents.  They offer their services to whoever can pay the most and they have no qualms about using their often formidable powers for destructive purposes."

selectmonster "Initiate of the Metal Orders"  # also "Adept of the Silver Order", "Adept of the Golden Order", "Adept of the Iron Order", "Master of the Silver Order", "Master of the Golden Order", "Master of the Iron Order"
descr "The Metal Orders are the oldest and most well respected of all the wizard orders.  The Initiate starts with a basic education that lays the foundation for higher studies.  This includes many household and gardening tasks to build the necessary character and discipline.  Only after being an Initiate for twenty years can it be determined which of the Orders are most suitable for each particular Initiate.  There are three different Metal Orders: Silver, Gold and Iron.  Gold might sound better than the others, but there is no rank among them and the Golden Order was actually founded after the other two Metal Orders."

selectmonster "Ice Witch"  # also "Frost Hag"
descr "In the winter parents often scare their children by saying that the Ice Witch will come for them if they don't obey their parents.  Nowadays the Ice Witches don't care if the children are obedient or not.  They steal those they can get their hands on and take them back to their Tower of Ice. Some children are raised as apprentices and some are eaten or maybe used for sinister rituals to prolong the winter."

selectmonster "Unknown Priest"  # also "Unknown Priestess"
descr "There are priests and priestess of all manner of religions and gods in Elysium.  The false religions are easy to spot because their priests have not been granted any magic powers from their made up gods."

selectmonster "Assassin"
descr "Assassins are highly skilled at stealth and can move undetected through enemy camps as easily as through a forest full of beasts.  The final test to become a full assassin consists of assassinating a beast, at least a wolf or larger creature, and then returning back alive.  The last part is particularly difficult, because the beasts are often in a pack and many apprentices do not return alive.  Although assassinating beasts is a useful talent for an warlord of Elysium, the assassins are more often hired to assassinate enemy mages before important battles."

selectmonster "Unexpected Hero"
descr "Sometime a farmboy finds his father's old magic sword and sometimes a farmboy just happens to be incredibly fast and strong.  What is common for all Unexpected Heroes is that they are ordinary boys living on ordinary farms and they are always in need of an adventure."

selectmonster "Hero"  # also "Heroine"
descr "Heroes have need of gold too and sometimes even a well known Hero sells his services for the right price.  Heroes are not only skillful, but often loaded with magic items too."

selectmonster "Old Weapon Master"
descr "In his youth the Weapon Master was a famous hero, brave and skilled with his sword.  Now he has become old and with old age comes wisdom.  Now he is more skillful with his blade than he ever was.  However, he has given up on adventuring and now he is happy to drink soup and teach younger people how to fight properly."

selectmonster "Peddlar"  # also "Merchant"
descr "The traditional Peddlar travels between villages and sells and buys goods to make money and to supply the villages with items they cannot make themselves.  Being a Peddlar in Elysium is extremely dangerous, because bears, deer and brigands are very real dangers for anyone who tries to travel between different settlements.  In order to survive the Peddlar has a quite a lot of guards and many rulers have mistaken a successful merchant for an invading army."

selectmonster "Caravan Guard"
descr "Being a Caravan Guard is not for the fainthearted.  The Caravan Guard has to face the many dangers of travelling between towns in Elysium, such as bandits, bears, snakes or maybe walking into a forest of aggressive giant mushrooms."

selectmonster "Damned Merchant"
descr "Although most merchants are unscrupulous, some are unusually shrewd and of low morals.  These ones often stay merchants after they have gone to Hell and there they can help the Devils and make a fortune at the same time."

selectmonster "Werewolf"
descr "Some people think that a Werewolf is a human that can turn into a Wolf, but it is actually a Wolf that can turn into a human.  This explains its poor skill at speaking the human language and its great appetite for killing.  At a quick glance a Werewolf can pass for a human, but no one would be fooled for long by this crude charade."

selectmonster "King"
descr "The King protects the nobles against brigands, beasts and other kinds of evil.  For this protection the King charges a quite hefty fee, as this protection is hard to provide in a place like Elysium.  The King's knights and soldiers are not always strong enough to beat the evil forces that roam Elysium, but they are certainly strong enough to beat down any noble who refuses to pay."

selectmonster "Princess"
descr "Dragons like to steal away beautiful highborn girls and by law the Princess is the most beautiful of them all.  So far the Dragons have not made an appearance at the royal castle in order to steal her away.  This has been much to the King's delight of course, as Dragons are truly vicious after all."

selectmonster "Bard"
descr "Every notable noble needs a Bard of their own.  A skillful Bard can spread the word of someone's valor and honor all over the realm.  A less skillful Bard is still good to have for entertainment at dinner parties and other festive occasions."

selectmonster "Brigand"  # also "Bandit"
descr "There are Brigands and Bandits all over Elysium, undermining all attempts at establishing a civilized society for men.  There are stories about good Brigands that steal from the rich and give to the poor, but these are just stories.  The real Brigands steal from whoever they can, keep the loot and then kill a few people for the fun of it."

selectmonster "Bandit King"
descr "The Bandit King has proclaimed himself Champion of the Common People and King of all Elysium. A false claim of course, but all manner of brigands are flocking to his cause."

selectmonster "Councilor"
descr "The Councilors are all old and wise men who have managed to live through the horrors that destroyed the Old Empire.  They are determined to do things right this time and rule the realm of living men to greatness once again."

selectmonster "Nymph"
descr "The Nymph appears as a girl of outworldly beauty and innocence.  Anyone who sees her will be enthralled by her looks and for the normal person it is not possible to see her true shape.  But by studying her behavior we can get a glimpse of her true nature.  She like to build her nest in trees, she eats breadcrumbs when presented with the opportunity and she likes to sit in ponds.  This all proves that her true form is that of a giant bird, which would also explain why she can move so far without being seen running."

selectmonster "Siren"
descr "On land the Siren appears as a large bird with the head of a human.  This indicates that Sirens are Nymphs that have not fully mastered the ability to change their appearance, so only the head is changed.  The seductiveness is still very powerful, just as with the Nymph.  In the sea the Siren looks more fishlike, probably because fish are not into birds."

selectmonster "Monument of Hades"  # also "Unfinished Monument"
descr "A colossal monument built to attract the attention of Hades can never be good.  This monument should be destroyed before it is too late."

selectmonster "Colossus"
descr "A truly gigantic construct built in ancient times when there was an abundance of good stone and capable mages.  The reason the Colossus has been deactivated for so long is probably because it seems unusually daft, even for a construct.  It is incapable of obeying orders, but at least it seems to have some loyalty to its new masters. "

selectmonster "Minotaur"
descr "It is disputed whether the Minotaur is a beast or a humanoid, because it has been seen associating with both Brigands and Deer.  That it can wield and use weapons effectively speaks for humanoid, but the fact that the Minotaur cannot speak indicates it is a beast.  Until more research has been done, it is safest to assume that the Minotaurs are beasts and stay away or kill them when possible."

selectmonster "Werebear"
descr "They will have to crawl through the skin of an old bear while the priest cover them with tattoos and markings. Upon returning their mind is different and they become grumpy and solitary. It is said that they now are possessed by the spirit of the bear, and can take that shape during battles. At least that is how the barbarians make their werebears, maybe they can reproduce normally too or be made by some other magic rituals."

selectmonster "Elder Dragon"  # also "Dragon", "Dragon Hatchling"
descr "Dragons love gold and other shiny objects, just like Trolls.  They also share the same excellent sense of smell and seem to get along quite well together.  The only reason for two such seemingly different species to get along is because they share all other traits.  Thus we can also know that Dragons like princesses and have an irrational dislike for Goats.  To demonstrate this, a Dragon hatchling and a Goat were placed in the same room, each on its own pile of gold coins.  This resulted in the Goat charging the dragon in an attempt to take his gold and thus ruining the demonstration.  Note, never use Goats for demonstrations."

selectmonster "God Vessel"
descr "In ancient times there was a war among gods.  When the false gods and their pantheons were defeated, the winning God bound them in the only vessels capable of holding god-spirits, the bodies of dead Titans.  The Titan bodies were entombed at the Roots of the Earth and the tomb was sealed with the aid of a young and innocent race with pure souls, the Pale Ones.  With their sacrifice, the prison was eternally sealed and peace returned to the world.  The few remaining Pale Ones were given the task of guarding the Chamber of the Seal and they have kept vigil ever since.  Now the Seal is broken and the Imprisoned Ones have returned, bound to the flesh of the God Vessels.  The God Vessel is tremendously powerful and will wreak havoc on the world unless destroyed or imprisoned once more."

selectmonster "Legion of Gods"
descr "In ancient times a power hungry God bound entire pantheons of gods in the bodies of three dead Titans.  Each of the three God Vessels contains a legion of imprisoned gods merged together into an entity of vast power.  When the Seal was broken, the God Vessels returned to the world to wreak havoc, but the Legion of Gods was still bound in the flesh of a dead Titan.  When the God Vessel was destroyed, the entire pantheon of mad gods emerged with unfettered powers, leaving destruction, madness and grief in their wake.  Hopefully the entity will leave Elysium for other planes of existence."

selectmonster "Wolf Tribe Shaman"
descr "Dressed in the pelt of a huge grey wolf the shaman only communicates in grunts, growls and odd dances.  According to some survivors the shaman will come out of his cave only to take the heart of a felled enemy, otherwise he will never leave his cave.  When the shaman is old enough he will crawl further inside the cave where he will just lie down and die.  It is said that the current shaman communicate with the dried out corpses of former shamans, and some rumors even say that there are over twenty old shamans lying in the cave waiting for the next one to join them in their eternal wolfdance."

selectmonster "Wolf Tribe Warrior"
descr "Moving in flocks in the mountains, the wolf tribe is always to be feared as they would lie in wait for any lone traveler or a poor traveler that falls behind his caravan.  Dressed in the remains of wolves or tattooed with hellish grins in their face, the wolf tribe is generally a fearsome sight.  Even more fearsome is their tradition to slaughter and devour one of their defeated enemies right after a battle."

selectmonster "Wolf Tribe Bowman"
descr "Though the preferred hunting method is to encircle their prey and defeat it by hand, weapons and claws, they do have their lone trackers and hunters who go out with only a bow for company. Though an outsider in the tribe they take a particular joy in felling people from the deer tribe with a well aimed arrow."

selectmonster "Deer Tribe Shaman"
descr "Few have had the chance to talk with a live deer tribe shaman, but from her clothing and odd decorations it appears as if it is the shaman who teaches her tribe in they ways of the deer.  Dressed in antlers and the skin of a deer one can only assume that it is the shaman who is leading her tribe in the ways of the deer.  It is said that when the shaman is old enough she will leave her tribe to travel with a bevy of deer.  This is most likely why most of the shamans found had been mauled by wolves."

selectmonster "Deer Tribe Warrior"
descr "Though far too small to form a nation of their own, this small nomadic tribe is fearsome enough in its own right.  Taking on the aspect of the deer they wander through forests and jungles looking for easily raided settlements.  Like the deer they prefer to attack from the protection of the forest, though they might perform raids on the steppe as well.  Their preferred way of attack is to amass upon an inferior foe."

selectmonster "Deer Tribe Bowman"
descr "The hunters of the tribe provide a good back up, dressed in deer skin and with war paintings they meld into the forest and can warn their tribe long before one knows of their whereabouts.  Their bowmen are rumored to be very apt at setting traps why it is always a bad idea to stray from the path in a dense forest."

selectmonster "Debug Sensei"
descr "Great Teacher Debug."

selectmonster "Spearman"
descr "Spearmen often compose the better part of the armies of men, because their equipment is relatively easy to manufacture.  They have basic close combat training and are equipped with light armor, shield and spear."

selectmonster "Swordsman"
descr "Swords are superior compared to spears, especially against armored opponents.  Given a choice, most soldiers would use the sword.  However, swords are also more difficult to manufacture, so most soldiers don't get this choice."

selectmonster "Pikeneer"
descr "The pike is an important weapon when fielding large armies.  Its length makes it possible to strike even from behind the front line and the Pikeneer also wears a heavy breastplate to compensate for the lack of a shield."

selectmonster "Heavy Infantry"
descr "Heavily armed and armored, these infantry soldiers are tough, but slow due to all the weight.  Their equipment requires much iron to produce, which explains why these soldiers are seldom seen in great numbers."

selectmonster "Archer"
descr "These soldiers are armed with bows, but without training and proper equipment for close combat.  Archers are often seen in great numbers in human armies, because they do not wear any armor and their bows are cheap to make."

selectmonster "Crossbowman"
descr "These soldiers are armed with crossbows that can penetrate thick armor at long range.  Crossbows have a good chance of killing even heavily armored troops, but cannot fire as often as a normal bow.  The largest drawback with crossbows is that they are more complex to manufacture than ordinary bows."

selectmonster "Captain"
descr "The Captain is an officer that is capable of commanding armies and making strategic decisions that are good for his master."

selectmonster "Scout"
descr "Every army should have a scout in it.  The scout will sneak around in the surrounding areas and discover hidden enemies before they can ambush the army.  In combat scouts join the ranks of the archers."

selectmonster "Catapult"
descr "This siege machine takes a long time to set up and aim and is only useful when sieging or defending a fortified location.  The catapult is not very accurate, but during sieges it is still very effective, as a well placed boulder can destroy the gates or maybe even kill an unlucky high ranking enemy commander or mage."

selectmonster "Militia"  # also "Angry Peasant"
descr "Unused unit"

selectmonster "Halberdier"
descr "When men came to Elysium, it was soon discovered that the usual spears and swords had little effect on heavily armored beasts like Giant Crabs.  The solution was an axe on a long pole that can be swung with much greater power.  This weapon became known as the halberd and is often used by the defenders of coastal towns."

selectmonster "Zweihander"
descr "The greatsword was originally not used by the common soldiers in Elysium.  However, after a major setback against superior numbers of Hoburghers, a faster way of killing a Hoburgher was needed.  With the greatsword it is possible to kill two or even three Hoburghers with a single sweep and turn the tide of battle against smaller foes.  This development gave rise to the zweihander troops who wield greatswords and wear heavier armor to compensate for the lack of a shield."

selectmonster "Longbowman"
descr "Longbowmen are the elite of the archers and it takes long years of training to be able to draw the longbow properly.  The result is quite impressive however, as the longbow can shoot further than ordinary bows and has almost as good armor penetration as a crossbow."

selectmonster "Trebuchet"
descr "Trebuchets are technologically advanced siege engines popular among Barons and other refined men of of Elysium.  Few Barons would field a catapult if a trebuchet was available, unless there was a surplus of cow leather and sinews after some great banquet.  Trebuchets take a long time to set up and aim and are only useful when sieging or defending a fortified location.  They fire huge loads of boulders and can hit several units with a single volley, but like the catapult they are not very accurate."

selectmonster "Tower Guard"
descr "Tower Guards are a solution to the various wildlife problems in Elysium.  Previously the Barons used to man their walls with longbowmen, which is sufficient against Deer attacks, but when the Serpents and Spiders climb up the walls, they are almost useless.  The tower guards can fire at long range against a closing enemy necessary and then engage any climbers in melee with their broadswords and shields to make short work of the invaders."

selectmonster "Cavalryman"
descr "The cavalryman is also known as the poor man's knight.  They may look like knights on their horses, but they are not nobles and they cannot afford the same heavy armor as the knights.  Still, they are well trained and a useful complement to real knights."

selectmonster "Ballista"
descr "Ballistae are oversized crossbows used by the Senatorial legions of Elysium.  At first they served to attack fortifications from afar, but it was soon discovered that they were equally useful when used to take out Trolls and ridiculously well armored knights."

selectmonster "Knight"
descr "Knights are elite troops, higher in station and far better trained than normal soldiers.  They are of noble birth or at least ennobled land owners, and of sufficient wealth to provide themselves with the finest armor and steeds.  The abundance of unclaimed land in Elysium makes it possible for the Baron to create many new nobles who in turn will provide him with knights and soldiers."

selectmonster "Unicorn Knight"
descr "Elysium has many creatures that would make much better battle mounts than a horse, but unfortunately none of them have turned out to be sufficiently friendly to be tamed.  However, there is one exception, the Unicorn.  The Unicorn seems to have some defect that makes it like young girls, so by sacrificing a young girl, it is possible to gain this truly magnificent beast as a mount.  The magic of the Unicorn rubs off on its rider and makes him immune to poison and he will recover from wounds at an amazing speed."

selectmonster "Baron"
descr "It takes a strong man to rule in Elysium and the Baron is very strong.  It is said that he has defeated a Moose in single combat and decorated his mantelpiece with its head.  The Baron is also from a noble lineage and owns the strongest castle in all of Elysium.  His noble blood inspires the common people with awe and no one of common blood would dare disappoint him.  Most other nobles ride horses into battle, but the Baron prefers to stay on foot.  That way he can swing his magic greatsword, which has been handed down from father to son for generations."

selectmonster "High Lord"
descr "The heads of the rich and more influential noble families are known as High Lords.  Their riches and noble blood make them well suited to leadership and they can inspire the common people to great deeds, like standing up to brigands and beasts.  The High Lords have the finest of horses and are able to travel quickly despite their heavy armor."

selectmonster "Levy"
descr "Levies are common people with cheap weapons and poor training in their use.  Usually these commoners have been ordered by some noble to arm themselves and protect their settlement against intruders."

selectmonster "Slinger"
descr "Slingers are simple peasants who have been armed with cheap weapons and received rudimentary training in how to use them.  Usually these peasants have been ordered by some noble to arm themselves and protect their settlement against intruders."

selectmonster "Court Mage"
descr "Having a mage in your employment is a sign of high status and all the great nobles have one.  A court mage can also do all matter of useful things like putting a person to sleep instantly or boosting his ruler's luck before he is off to play games."

selectmonster "Magus"  # also "High Magus"
descr "The Magi are old mages who have become both powerful and wise.  Only the Barons can afford to employ one of these experienced magicians and take advantage of their considerable wisdom."

selectmonster "Alchemist"  # also "Master Alchemist"
descr "The members of the Alchemists' Guild are the only ones to know the secret of making gold and they guard it jealously.  Unfortunately they are not able to produce it in vast quantities, but a small amount can be made for their employer each month.  It may be that the rate of gold production is not a real limit, but rather a restriction imposed by the guild to prevent too much gold from being created.  Regardless of the real reason, the Alchemists claim they cannot produce more gold than they already do."

selectmonster "Monk"
descr "Monks are usually boring men who like to preach about El, the coming of the Apocalypse and how we are all going to die in flames if we aren't dead of pestilence before that.  They do have their uses though, as they know the secret of creating good farmlands from seemingly useless swamps."

selectmonster "Bishop"
descr "As the lowest ranking of the senior priests, the Bishop has quite a good job.  He gets to order people around in the name of El and is still of low enough importance that El won't take any notice of him.  The common people pray for El to notice them, but the Bishop has been around long enough to know that being noticed by El is most likely a really bad thing.  All those stories about El smiting people with fire, lightning, floods, diseases or curses seem to have some truth in them."

selectmonster "Arch Bishop"  # also "Cardinal", "Pontiff"
descr "The senior priests of El are responsible for ensuring that Elysium is properly converted.  Ultimately it is the highest ranking priest who carries this responsibility, which makes that position less sought after than it would otherwise be.  While the priests preach that El forgives those who repent, the senior priests know that El is really more into punishing than forgiving if he gets to choose."

selectmonster "Saint"
descr "Many believe that the Saints are sent by God to perform wonders in his place and lead the righteous to a great victory.  However, the Saints are easy to kill and seem to be bereft of any divine authority.  They are skillful demagogues however, and the believers will gladly follow them and the common people are likely to convert when listening to their speeches."

selectmonster "Flagellant"
descr "The flagellants started out as a group of fanatics who enjoyed beating themselves with their own flails, all in all a very harmless thing for bystanders.  As the flagellant movement spread, the flagellant quickly realized that it is much more fun to flog the bystanders than to flog themselves.  The flagellants still claim their weapons are only for self-flagellation, but anyone who refuses to convert on the spot will soon see and feel the falsehood of that statement."

selectmonster "Temple Guard"
descr "The Temple Guards consider themselves an elite guard that protects the Church from the unbelievers who may wish it harm.  While their faith is strong, their discipline is severely lacking and they will follow the first self proclaimed prophet to come along and leave the church undefended without a second thought."

selectmonster "Paladin"
descr "While the Paladins claim to be appointed by El himself, they are actually members of the Church and will take orders from those of higher rank.  For some reason only noble people seem to be appointed as Paladins, which indicates that even El isn't powerful enough to turn a peasant into something knight-like."

selectmonster "Templar"
descr "Take a knight, get an Arch Bishop to bless him and you will have a Templar instead.  Most Templars will talk about El and how they last saw him when looking at their dried up cup of tea or in a puddle of dirt.  However, in practice they are very much like knights and form the elite of the army and enjoy beating up enemies with inferior arms and armor."

selectmonster "Apocalyptic Rider" # EXCEPT this description applies ONLY to definition 1 of Apocalyptic Rider
descr "And there went out another horse that was red, and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from Elysium, and that they should kill one another, and there was given unto him a great sword."

selectmonster "Apocalyptic Rider" # EXCEPT this description applies ONLY to definition 2 of Apocalyptic Rider
descr "And I saw, and behold a white horse, and he that sat on him had a bow, and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering, and to conquer."

selectmonster "Apocalyptic Rider" # EXCEPT this description applies ONLY to definition 3 of Apocalyptic Rider
descr "And I beheld, and lo a black horse, and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand."

selectmonster "Apocalyptic Rider" # EXCEPT this description applies ONLY to definition 4 of Apocalyptic Rider
descr "And I looked, and behold a pale horse, and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hades followed with him.  And power was given unto them over Elysium, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of nature."

selectmonster "Pilgrim"
descr "The Pilgrims believe that revelations from God are hidden throughout Elysium and only by travelling to every possible place will they find the meaning of life.  An extremely dangerous thing to do in Elysium, but the Pilgrims are not entirely sane and disregard such practical matters."

selectmonster "Angel"
descr "A divine being in human form, the Angel is winged and armed with only the words of El.  Angels are surrounded by a radiant aura that intimidates mortals and prevents them from harming the holy being."

selectmonster "Harbinger"
descr "A divine being in human form, the Harbinger is winged and armed with a heavenly horn that destroys undead beings and unworthy humans.  Harbingers are surrounded by a radiant aura that intimidates mortals and prevents them from harming the angelic being."

selectmonster "Arch Angel"
descr "A divine being in human form, the mighty Arch Angel is winged and armed with a flaming sword that can will cause the unworthy to burn.  Arch Angels are surrounded by a radiant aura that intimidates mortals and prevents them from harming the Angel."

selectmonster "Seraph"
descr "The Seraphim are high servants and heavenly attendants of the Celestial Sphere.  They serve El as he chose to claim Elysium and proclaim His glory.  They are surrounded by a divine splendor that must be shielded lest it strike the world with unbearable might.  The Seraph has three pairs of wings.  The first pair covers the face of the being, the second pair covers its naked feet and the third pair lifts the angelic apparition into the air."

selectmonster "Ophan"
descr "The Ophanim, or Wheels, are angelic beings of the Celestial Sphere.  They serve El as he chose to claim this world and proclaim His Glory.  Unfathomable and otherworldly, they bear witness to the splendor of the Radiance of El.  The Ophanim appear as a brilliance covered by four wings, that when unfolded, will reveal a wheel intersecting another wheel of gleaming brass.  The rim of the wheel is covered by eyes of sparkling chrysolite and the being is surrounded by a blaze like that of the sun."

selectmonster "Celestial Lion"
descr "El is not only the God of all righteous men, El is also the God of all righteous beasts.  This can be seen clearly in the Celestial Lions that are sent to Elysium in order to eat all those not worthy of El."

selectmonster "Inquisitor"  # also "High Inquisitor"
descr "The Inquisitors have taken it upon themselves to rid the world of evil, and especially the lurking evil that most people wouldn't even know exists.  This includes Demons, Trolls, Witches, Heretics, those who don't pay the tithe to the Church and many others.  The safest way to be on the good side is to pay an extra tithe directly to the Inquisitors."

selectmonster "Grand Master"
descr "The grand master is in charge of a Holy Order of Crusaders.  The Holy Orders usually have a formidable force with which to strike the enemies of the Church."

selectmonster "Crusader"
descr "The crusader is a knight that has joined a holy order.  Sometimes the knights join a holy order because they want to help the Church, but usually they join to have the tithes of their family reduced."

selectmonster "Great Enchanter"  # also "Enchanter", "Enchanter's Apprentice"
descr "Many consider the Enchanter to be a combination of craftsman, artist and charlatan rather than a true mage.  He forms objects by hand and then tricks them to start moving around and when an object has started moving, it will never go back to being an inanimate object again.  If Enchanters were allowed to spread, Elysium would soon be thrown into chaos with ordinary objects trying to take the place of the living and not staying still like they are supposed to.  Even if the Enchanter is not a respected mage, you should be vary of his creations.  A walking iron mine is just as hard to destroy as you might imagine, and it will destroy everything that tries to hinder it."

selectmonster "Dancing Tools"
descr "Dancing Tools floats in the air and aid gentle people with chores and manual labor.  Living in a farm or village with dancing tools is easy and undemanding.  While some become lazy at the opportunities granted by animated brooms and buckets, most people will feel grateful to the enchanter giving them such pleasures and increase their produce.  Income can be doubled if enough dancing tools are present in a settlement.  If the settlement is attacked the living tools will help in the defense."

selectmonster "Animated Tools"
descr "Animated Tools floats in the air and aid miners with mining and hauling ore.  Working in a mine with animated tools is easy and undemanding.  Most miners working with such wondrous tools will feel grateful to the enchanter and work even harder to increase their produce.  Income in gold and iron can be doubled if enough animated tools are present in a mine.  If the settlement is attacked the living tools will help in the defense."

selectmonster "Dancing Sword"
descr "The dancing sword floats in the air and can fight better than most swordsmen.  The best part however, is that it doesn't require any salary or food and it never complains."

selectmonster "Living Bow"
descr "The living bow can shoot as well as an exceptionally skilled archer, but without requiring the human part."

selectmonster "Animated Ballista"
descr "The animated ballista floats along a few feet over the ground and fires huge arrows on the enemies all by itself. That fact that it floats along all by itself without complaining about how heavy it is makes it much preferable to using ordinary ballistas drawn by men."

selectmonster "Animated Armor"
descr "A full plate armor that has been convinced to stop being an inanimate object and then given a large sword to fight with.  The full plates are grateful to be alive and will obey the Enchanter's every word."

selectmonster "Terracotta Soldier"
descr "The Terracotta Soldier is skillfully crafted from mud and then enchanted to come to life.  Being made of clay makes it immune to fire and quite resistant to arrows as well."

selectmonster "Gargoyle"
descr "Gargoyles are usually inanimate monster statues that sit on top of churches in a futile effort to scare away wild beasts.  This gargoyle is different however, as it is no longer stationary and wild beasts would be wise to stay away."

selectmonster "Necrotod"
descr "A snake made from various bones and then given life with a complex ritual, the result is something between a golem and an undead being.  Luckily the Necrotod is mindless, because otherwise it would probably have gone mad, considering it is made from the bones of multiple beings and often also multiple races.  What makes the Necrotod a formidable weapon is its peculiar dance that can hypnotize men and beast alike and turn the targets into willing slaves for the rest of their lives."

selectmonster "Guardian"
descr "A stone statue that has been given large eyes so it can see everything and a godlike stature so it can blast enemies with lightning bolts.  The Guardian has been created without legs to ensure that it will never leave its post."

selectmonster "Animated Statue"
descr "Old statues that depict living beings really long to begin moving after standing still for so long.  This makes it especially easy to convince these old lumps of stone to get moving and do some work for their new master."

selectmonster "Flesh Golem"
descr "A golem made from flesh and bones.  The advantage of building a golem from living materials is that it is easy to bring to life and it will even heal itself should it be damaged.  The disadvantage is that it is extremely fragile compared to golems made from harder materials."

selectmonster "Wood Golem"  # also "Oak Golem", "Clay Golem", "Ice Golem", "Stone Golem", "Iron Golem", "Silver Golem", "Onyx Golem", "Crystal Golem", "Gold Golem"
descr "Golems are powerful constructs that are just as hard to kill as the material they are made from.  The more powerful golems have special abilities that are inherent to their building material."

selectmonster "Crystal"
descr "A construct made from crystal which is capable of firing sharp crystal shards at nearby enemies."

selectmonster "Senator"
descr "It is recorded that when the last Imperial benefactor of this College and Emperor Dentatus III was assassinated by the commander of his Praetorian Guard, the Old Empire fell into a long civil war that eventually led to its dissolution.  Local leaders set up their own small kingdoms and dukedoms.  Where other leaders carved out new titles and orders for themselves, the ancestor of the current Senator was a strict adherent to using proper paperwork.  Because there was a lack of legal precedence to dissolve an empire, the Senator was stuck with both his title and the ways to properly run his province.  With the Senator representing the Empire, our College could still receive some small funding from the Senatorial State.  However, lately the costs of the scribes that have to handle the paperwork to obtain the stipend have far exceeded the stipend itself, and some argue that we should stop applying for it.  The rather strong chapter of scribes has so far refused any such suggestion.^Though some of or records still mention the Imperial Capital, its exact location has been lost.  All explorers who have set out to locate the Capital have expired due to hostile Trolls, Deer and Ghosts.  Our records have only given vague references to the whereabouts of the capital, and according to a theory formulated by Crispina, some of the evidence suggests that it was accidentally teleported in an attempt to restore the Empire through complex magical means.  Recent reports indicate that the current Senator again has Imperial ambitions, and should he find the Capital, he might even choose to proclaim himself the new Emperor. "

selectmonster "Emperor"
descr "Though lost for generations, the realm has now seen the rise of a new Emperor.  After defeating the Capital, a week long revelry with many daily hecatombs being sacrificed and wine given out to high and low, a hungover and decimated population of the Capital arose to meet a newly proclaimed Emperor.  One of the first actions of the newly inaugurated Emperor was to issue coins with his portrait.  Our archives reveal that this was fully in accordance to tradition, and despite voices refuting his claim, we have come to conclude that the Emperor is legally appointed.  Our archivist can also share the good news that the Emperor is considering becoming the new benefactor of this college.  Our faculty of scribes is now fully involved with the task of filling out the proper forms for the transition to Imperial authority."

selectmonster "Dark Emperor"
descr "Though lost for generations, the realm has now seen the rise of a new Emperor.  After taking back the Capital from the undead, a week long revelry was proclaimed and wine was given out to high and low.  According to tradition the inhabitants of the capital should celebrate the Emperor, and could they rise from their graves they would undoubtedly celebrate the new Emperor.  One of the first actions of the newly inaugurated Emperor was to issue coins with his portrait.  Our archives reveal that this was also fully in accordance to tradition, and despite voices refuting his claim, we have come to conclude that the Emperor is legally appointed.  Our archivist can also share the good news that the Emperor is considering becoming the new benefactor of this college.  Our faculty of scribes is now fully involved with the task of filling out the proper forms for the transition to Imperial authority."

selectmonster "Empress"
descr "Being a former mage and imperial mistress, the Empress now wields considerable power from her throne.  It is said that she still shares some loyalties to her order of mages, but any such suggestion is widely dismissed and ought not to be uttered in groups larger than three.  The festivities in connection with the wedding ceremony lasted for three days and have yet again postponed our stipend."

selectmonster "God Emperor"
descr "Several philosophers argue that all it that is needed to attain godhood is to have enough people believe that you are divine, while others claim that you need to possess some kind of divine spark to begin with.  However, following the protocol of earlier Emperors, recording each decree in three copies and allowing for citizens to refute his claim at the gladiatorial pits, and after issuing a myriad of statues dedicated to himself, the Emperor has now issued a decree according to which he is to be worshipped as the Divine Emperor.  Though this might be a good opportunity to study a transition into godhood, the Department of Divine Studies has been reluctant to send for a request for some of the Divine Imperial flesh."

selectmonster "God Empress"
descr "Some claim that a divine status was the ultimate goal of the Empress, and something her magical order has striven for for generations.  However, everyone who has claimed to possess evidence has since left the Empire, often on a solitary quest to defeat the Troll King.  While it is true that her administration has sped up many of the slow legal or administrative processes, she has also made several excuses for not paying out the Imperial stipend to our College."

selectmonster "Centurion"
descr "The Senatorial army is strictly divided in units of predefined size, power and equipment.  The Centurion leads a centuria, the base army unit in the Senator's army.  A centuria may never exceed nor fall under 100 soldiers.  Should there for any reason be a lack of men, the Senator has set up a system in which future soldiers are listed to the centuria.  Thus a centuria will always consist of 100 legionnaires.  When the soldiers are conscripted, they will then be issued a name and background according to those already listed.  As this process does take some time, the legions of the Senator can be  a bit slow to muster.  The most striking example of this procedure emerged after the battle of Phylotermae where one of our couriers noticed how one of the centurias consisted of a Centurion, three men and a large pile of parchment scrolls containing the names of the soldiers-to-be. The three surviving soldiers had quite a hard time setting up tents for their as yet non-existent comrades."

selectmonster "Heliodromus"
descr "One of the more important cults in the imperial army and legal courts is the Cult of the Conquering Sun.  Initially it was a cult whose adherents were clerks, judges and other scribes who need daylight for their work, but lately it has won more and more influence in the Senatorial armies.  Today their priests claim that the sun and the presence of its priests will lead to unprecedented victories.  They started their rise to prominence in the armies  a few decades ago during the wars against the rebellious Necromancer Solidorus, against whom the powers of the Heliodromi were exceedingly efficacious.  Any connection between Solidorus and a local chapter of the Sun Cult has been deemed by a legal court to be unwarranted rumors bordering on slander.  The order is still struggling to construct a good theological solution to why there is night if the sun is invincible."

selectmonster "Renata"
descr "Renatae are part of an ancient order of Magi and Magae that officially study the mysteries of life, water and bodily fluids.  They are also keepers of most of the genealogical records of the province.  In return for a generous donation to the order, they can find a prominent past for almost any citizen.  This has led to some legal problems with two families claiming the same line of ancestry.  They are rumored to also try to influence present bloodlines through marriages with the right families, through manipulation of lineages and even through forgetting to record some less fortunate incestuous couplings.  Many of the Renatae end up married into prominent families and some have even married into the Senatorial family in the past.  Many of the Renatae have joined the order at a young age, hand picked from different families across the realm.  Because they are often married into powerful families, few parents refuse the request of the Renatae to induct their children into the order."

selectmonster "Renatus"
descr "Known to everyone as the oldest of the order of Renatae, the Renatus is a keeper of records, the preserver of magic and the end of a family line bred for their magical abilities.  Though his magical abilities do not exceed that of other mages in the realm, he has somehow stumbled upon the path to immortality through a combination of  alchemical residues, a strong magical affinity, a strict frugal diet and celibacy.  The latter two have kept most alchemists from trying his path, claiming that there must be an easier way.  Hieronyma the Clouded claims that it would be impossible achieve immortality this way and that they have instead come upon a way of copying the body and mind of the Renatus that makes him seem immortal.  According to her the old basins under the main palace of Renatae are filled with innumerable copies of the Renatus, ready to be sent out should the previous copy die.  Though the Renatus seems to be the oldest and most powerful member of the order, there are claims that a secret coven of old Renatea governs the order with the goal of creating the perfect human.  Though there is no substance to such rumors, many heroes have bragged about how they have succeeded in seducing a local Renata."

selectmonster "Leo"
descr "It is said that the Sun Cult requires its members to contribute generously in order to gain access to the deeper mysteries of the order.  For some reason they have gained many wealthy followers who have quickly risen in the ranks.  It is true that the Cult is not without a certain political influence, something that may have attracted some of their new followers.  Their militaristic views have also made them quite popular among the soldiers, which is why they have had no problems in setting up certain elite squads consisting of experienced soldiers who get a quick introduction to the mysteries of the cult.  Their leaders are said to be favored by the sun, and seem to often comes from wealthy families without either martial experience or a lineage that would give them a chance to command.  The Leo contributes the armor of his entire unit, which has provided the local bronze smiths that are part of the cult with good business opportunities.  The commander himself is dressed in a polished bronze plate decorated with a an image of a lion surrounded by a flame-like mane.  Some say that he is also given the ability to channel a minor aspect of the solar powers of the priests.  At his side and dealing with the everyday duties of leading the unit is one of the senior soldiers."

selectmonster "Princeps Solaris"
descr "While the present martial focus of the Solar Cult has made them quite popular among the soldiers, that is not the case of their elite guard, the Principes Solares.  Recruited from among the more experienced soldiers and given shiny new suits of armor, they consider themselves better than most other legionnaires.  It appears that they are given some introduction to the Cult from both their commander and some of their senior colleagues in the squad.  Though the mysteries of the Cult are unknown to anyone outside it, they do seem to stress other aspects of the teachings than the priests.  Though a ban of dice games could possibly be interpreted by what the priests says, the collection of protection money from younger recruits or the joy they take in burning down buildings, tents, fields or even people does not seem to correspond to anything the Heliodromi say."

selectmonster "Serpent Acolyte"
descr "During the early days of the Empire every town had its own local Serpent Cult.  However, through the rise of a very charismatic Serpent Priest, who according to some genealogists was a younger brother to the Emperor Squameus IV, one of the cults came to rise into sole prominence.  At this point the cult was also embraced by the Emperor, who outlawed all other snake cults.  Today the Great Snake seems to be sleeping and most people consider the cult to be just an archaic remnant of the Old Empire.  However, according to some legal documents they can still claim to be the official cult of the Empire.  In the resolution of a recent lawsuit initiated by the Solar Cult, it was concluded that rather than being the sole official Imperial Cult, it is the official Serpent Cult of the Empire, which allows any other types of cult to be freely established.  Being a rather archaic cult, the Serpent Cult chooses its acolytes from among a small group of families whenever a child is born carrying the traditional Sign of the Serpent ‚Äì flaky skin, split tongue or parietal eyes."

selectmonster "Serpent Priest"
descr "Having been a part of the Empire for a few hundred years, the traditions of the Serpent Cult are quite well known.  After their initial thirty years as an acolyte, which mainly involves feeding the snakes, polishing the temple silver, or cleaning out the latrines, the Acolytes are promoted to the rank of Priest.  Originally there was some test to weed out the ones who were unworthy, but the diminishing number of Acolytes has forced them to elevate all Acolytes to Priests, and the Great Snake is only fed with slaves these days.  The Serpent Priests are mainly taking care of the city snakes, but are also responsible for interpreting the snakes' desires and choosing the snakes' consorts among the city slaves."

selectmonster "Pontifex Serpentis"
descr "The most senior of the Serpent Priests are sometimes elevated to the rank of Pontifex Serpentis.  The ritual of elevation to the post of Pontifex includes commanding a host of smaller Snakes and Serpents to form a bridge across one of the major rivers in Elysium.  If the priest survives he will immediately be taken to the main temple of the Snake Cult, where the newly appointed Pontifex is trapped within the main hall for thirteen months together with the Great Serpent.  Each day a fire is lit by the Pontifex and if grey smoke rises from the temple roof the pontifex is still alive.  Should black smoke rise, the Pontifex is dead and his ashes must be collected.  Should white smoke arise at the end of the thirteen months, the Pontifex will have surpassed the ordeal of the Great Serpent.  The Pontifex will then be freed, ready to rule the cult.^ Exactly what powers the Pontifex wields is hidden in the mysteries of the Snake Cult, but it is said that he can take the shape of a large snake.  Some rumors say that the Pontifex must mate with the Great Serpent in order to create a new Snake, which would explain why so many of the old Pontifices have been devoured by the Serpent."

selectmonster "Reveller"
descr "While the Empire, or presently the Senator, and every subject under his rule represents the civilized world, there are some who seem to succumb to chaos.  At certain times each year, during the Lupercalia, some men and women, strangely enough mainly clerks, lawyers, merchants and Lictors, shed their clothes and run into the woods to participate in decidedly carnal orgies.  Though some seem to be filled with an uncontrolled lust for these activities, others join just for the thrill of it.  However, these orgies are quite overrated, with cheap wine, aching bodies and pine cones in places best left unmentioned.  Those who are truly afflicted by this madness seem to be filled with some strange power and when they find the right place for these festivities, ancient sites of chaos can be stirred."

selectmonster "Satyr"
descr "It seems that at times the feasting of the uncontrolled revellers will plant a seed of chaos at certain ancient sites, reawakening the forces of old.  Though we do not make use of such beings anymore, some Satyrs have been lured to join the armies.  They are particularly attracted by the chance for a carnal encounter with either men or women.  They are the first of the ancient beings to arrive at the site of the revellers' orgies, and then join passing armies just for the fun of it.  Satyrs are lewd, obnoxious and generally a pest to the surrounding landscape, prone to break into wine-cellars and seducing anyone they come across.  The best option is usually to fool them into your enemy's realm."

selectmonster "Maenad"
descr "After one of the ancient forests has been dedicated to chaos and debauchery, some of the female revellers will be overcome with chaos, transforming into murderous beasts, devouring and butchering any man that they come across.  It is said that this affliction will remain and they are usually not allowed back home.  Instead the madness will grow and they will search the plains for any man who walks by himself late at night.  Neither rank nor heritage will protect the lone traveler from the hunger of the Maenads.  Hexapodes, the renowned arachnologist, has pointed out that a similar pattern of behavior can be found among certain spiders and insects, and has suggested that the Maenads are in fact suffering from some kind of parasite."

selectmonster "Hamadryad"
descr "Another creature that may appear in the wake of the festivities in the ancient forests are the Hamadryads, most likely lured there by the smell of blood in the forest.  In older texts they are described as guardians of the forest, but have lately mainly appeared as vengeful beings who lure men into the forests where they kill or trap them. "

selectmonster "Flamen"
descr "In old times any construction of bridges and temples as well as any declaration of war demanded a sacrifice of a hecatomb to the Elysian pantheon.  An Elysian hecatomb is one hundred sheep, some of which may be goats instead as long as they can be kept under control.  The sacrifices were performed by the Flamen, who wielded considerable power at the time.  In order to balance that power, the Flamen was limited in several ways and still is.  He may not touch iron, meat, beans or living horses.  He is always required to wear the Flamen headdress, even when sleeping, and he may not look at an armed army.  Some of the more creative Emperors of old added to the lists of what a Flamen could and should do.  After the gods had demanded a particularly vast number of hecatombs from Emperor Reus IV, the Emperor ruled that when the Flamen spoke on non-religious matters, he had to bow to the senior member of the Senate between each syllable. ^ With new cults appearing, these sacrifices became less and less important, and today the Flamen's sacrifices mainly concern less important things, such as weddings, the inauguration of a new porch and similar events.  However, the restrictions still remain, which is why it is a rather unpopular position.  It is now generally given to the member of the Senator's council who arrives last at the yearly Senatorial meeting."

selectmonster "Augur"
descr "The Senators have always used different ways to try to predict the outcome of an upcoming war, a predecessor's pending death and similar important questions.  The official stance in the Empire, or what is left of it, is that reading the flight and activities of birds can give such answers.  Several tomes have been written on the subject of how to interpret different birds in different times of the year.  The flight of the birds is considered to reflect the winds and the messages they carry between the gods.  This is of course utter nonsense, as most learned people know the future can only reliably be read through the liver of a Goat that has roamed freely in the area in which one aims to predict a possible outcome.  The closer to the subject that it has grazed the more accurate the predictions will be."

selectmonster "Veles"
descr "One of the basic troops of the Senatorial army.  Being drafted from among the poorest in society, they will most often come with just a shield and a javelin.  If they survive a few years of service and save up enough loot, they could invest in some armor for the chance to join some of the other troops of the army.  Chances are however, that they will desert once they have saved up enough money to buy themselves some decent armor.  In any case, they are most likely to either die or gamble their money away, as plebs usually do."

selectmonster "Hastatus"
descr "Somewhat better armored than the Velites, the Hastati make up the main bulk of the army.  Though their chances of survival are slightly better, they are often used as fireball fodder, being the first in line in any battle.  If they survive 25 years of service, they will be given a a small farm upon their release from their contract.  Most will rejoin within a year after they have pawned their farm and drunk most of the money.  This was seen as a regrettable loss to the Senatorial finances until all pawn businesses were expropriated by the state, and pawned estates reissued to the next generation of soldiers."

selectmonster "Princeps"
descr "After serving half their contracted time of 25 years, the legionnaires who have survived that long and not proven themselves completely useless will be promoted to Princeps.  Like the Hastati, they are armed with javelins and gladii, their signature short swords.  In the ancient Empire they were issued long spears, but after an incident in which an inept Acolyte of the Serpentis Cult tried to disarm the enemy with a spell that turned long wooden objects into snakes and the barbarians still had their long knives, the army renewed itself.  Principes armed with short swords rather than long spears are also less likely to dismount a mounted Senator who visits the army camp."

selectmonster "Triarius"
descr "If a Princeps returns for a second term, or if someone can afford to buy themselves a heavier armor when joining the army, they are instead given the rank of Triarius.  As such they are issued a large shield and a pike.  The Senatorial treasurers have concluded that it would be disastrous for the economy to put these troops into the fray, allowing them to die like the less armored legionnaires.  Instead, they are, according to the economic directive, placed in the back lines of any legion, pushing the greener recruits forwards with their pikes."

selectmonster "Standard"
descr "Last year a record was set with a Standard Bearer surviving for 14 months, the previous record being just under a year.  While it is indeed an honorable and, for a soldier, well paid position, it is also usually of quite short duration.  There have been those who have suggested buying an automata from some Enchanter to do the same job.  But experiments have proven that automata do not have a positive effect on the troop morale and are difficult to give counter orders once the battle has started.  A disastrous experiment with standard bearing automata was performed at the horrendous battle of Griffon Gorge.  In an attempt to engage the inferior enemy, the legion tried to cross the river at a known crossing point. Halfway into the crossing scouts noted that the ground had been undermined and the officers ordered a halt.  However, the standard bearing automata trudged on and so did the rest of the legion, pressing the front troops out into the river or into the trap.  The return of scattered remains of the legion and an unscathed automata proved another disadvantage with not using a proper soldier, because the automata could not be punished afterwards.  The Enchanter was of course later charged with and found guilty of reckless spending of Imperial resources.  Today most Standard Bearers are Gladiators who have a rather short life expectancy anyway."

selectmonster "Gladiator"
descr "Today the gladiatorial games are a cheap imitation of what they once were.  What has been described in Imperial literature as a sophisticated, subtle art has been replaced with cheap tricks to entertain the masses.  In the past the gladiatorial fights were made to simulate the great battles of the Empire, and Gladiators were dedicated to the art of fighting.  In this day and age all they talk about is money, fame and freedom.  Still, a Gladiator is a worthy fighter and upon gaining their freedom many are given the chance to join the army as an auxiliary or special troop."

selectmonster "Retiarius"
descr "Lately the managers of the gladiatorial games have tried to spice up the fights with Gladiators dressed up in outrageous arms and armor ‚Äì ant helmets, griffon beaks and even mule skins are donned by the combatants.  In the past the only difference would be the local armor of the different combatants, but the masses of today are too easily distracted and need some kind of show.  One of the more popular costumes is that of a fisherman, complete with net and trident.  While it provides the masses with some cheap laughs, it has risen to such popularity that some even manage to win their freedom.  O tempora, o mores."

selectmonster "Praetorian Guard"
descr "The elite of the Senatorial army, mainly used to protect the Palace and the Senator.  The Praetorian Guards are picked from among the best of the soldiers and they have better pay, a shorter contract and some legal exemptions.  Originally they were used to protect the general of the army but it was soon realized that they are put to better use by the Capital or the Palace.  Since they cannot be charged with unlawfully entering a home, they have often been sent to investigate the personal belongings of political enemies of the Senator.  This freedom has also meant that the Praetorians have helped themselves rather freely to food or other things from the homes of many citizens.  However, for a small fee the Praetorians will protect you instead."

selectmonster "Imperial Statue"
descr "In ancient times the Emperor would have put up statues of himself in any major settlement.  This has often been described as an act of vanity by many historians.  However, a few opposing theories have been put forth.  By sharing his image in both statues and coins, the Emperor would be present in the mind of every citizen.  When such an awareness reaches a certain level, it would give the Emperor a sort of divine focus or divine aegis if he so desires.  This can then be redirected and focused through the statues and there has been speculation that it would keep the citizens calm, giving them a sense of being watched at all times - which would explain the elaborate eyes in many statues.  It has even been argued that the statues at times would shoot lightning towards unruly subjects.  Though that is a mere bedtime story today, it would explain some of the darkened burnt spots in plazas near such statues.  A more reasonable explanation for the statues is that they would represent the Emperor regardless of any troops being present or not, and the settlement cannot fall until the statue is removed.  This is the current policy of the Senator, who has tried to reclaim some cities where such statues still stand by suing them at a local court."

selectmonster "Barbarian Leader"
descr "The Barbarians originate in previously unknown areas where dwell kings and tribes, whose existence has only been recently revealed to us by war.  Their original countries are still unknown to most civilized people but descriptions by adventurous explorers of Barbaricum, with its uninviting lands and unpleasant climate, its dreary aspect and its social gloom do not invite travels into those areas.  The many tribes claim to all originate from one of the many sons their deities are supposed to have birthed.  Still to this day some of these tribes quarrel over the birthright of these ancient gods. ^ Notwithstanding considerable local diversities, their land as a rule consists of tangled forests and dismal swamps, the rainfall being greater on the side towards the larger mountains.  They choose their kings for their noble birth and their generals for their prowess.  The king's power is neither unlimited nor arbitrary, because as in most of the simpler nations, it is tangled in tradition."

selectmonster "Mounted Chief"
descr "The generals owe their authority less to their military rank than to their example and the admiration they engender by it, if they are dashing, if they are conspicuous, if they charge ahead of the line.  This has often led to foolish onslaughts in which several groups charge ahead against the enemy at the same time.  A general who does not panic in the face of such an onslaught can use that very trait against them, and instead provoke the differing enemy units to fight one another for the chance to reach the enemy first.  As each chief only leads troops of his own kin, they are loyal to the chief, but have nothing against slaughtering allied troops, which is why old battlefields of Barbarian wars are the joy of any scavenging Necromancer."

selectmonster "Barbarian Lancer"
descr "They carry lances, 'frameae' as they call them, with the iron point narrow and short, but so sharp and so easy to handle that they employ them either for stabbing or for throwing as occasion demands.  A lance and a shield are arms enough for a horseman, though the Lancers are often given thick hides or scale armor that will protect both themselves and their horse during a charge.  Their horses are not remarkable for their beauty or speed, nor are they trained to complex revolutions like ours; the riders charge straight forward, or wheel in a single turn to the right, the formation of the troop being such that there is no rear rank."

selectmonster "Barbarian Cavalry"
descr "The lesser cavalry of the Barbarians will charge up behind the Lancers, loose a few shots and then attack with their spears.  They consider this position the least honorable, and several of them have been demoted to this position after returning from a lost battle in which their chief also survived.  It is not unusual that the demoted soldiers hang themselves out of shame or try to get killed in the next battle."

selectmonster "Barbarian Warrior"
descr "They all possess precisely the same physical characteristics, fierce eyes, unruly hair, and large frames which are good only for a spurt; they certainly have not a corresponding power of endurance for hard work, while, although inured by the nature of their climate and soil to hunger and cold, they have never learnt to withstand heat and thirst.  Generally speaking, the footmen are the most numerous, and the fighting line therefore is composed of both arms combined, all the fastest runners among the young men being chosen for the van, and by their great speed of foot being admirably suited for a cavalry engagement.  Not being a crafty or a cunning race, they furthermore disclose their secret thoughts in the freedom of the feast, and so the minds of all lie open and discovered.  In quenching their thirst they are by no means so temperate; let them but be given all the intoxicating liquor they choose to drink, and vice will make an easier conquest of them than the sword."

selectmonster "Barbarian Swordsman"
descr "Even iron is by no means abundant with them, as we may gather from the character of their weapons.  Only a few have swords, and those who carry a sword are considered to have higher rank than a warrior with an axe.  They make no display of ornament, only they are very careful in the colors they use for the devices on their shields.  Few possess such a thing as a breastplate, and only a man or two here and there a helmet or headpiece.  Their line of battle is drawn up in wedge-shaped columns; to fall back, however, provided only a man comes on again, is held to be good tactics, not cowardice.  Even in a defeat they carry off the bodies of their comrades.  Throwing away the shield is the crowning disgrace, and a man who has so dishonored himself may neither take part in the rites of religion nor enter the general assembly; many such survivors from the battlefield have been known to end their shame by hanging themselves."

selectmonster "Barbarian Bowman"
descr "Though generally too lazy to perform any real work, most hunters enjoy hunting, and are thus rather good with a bow.  However, in a battle it is considered a weapon for the weak, and is thus carried mainly by those too old, too crippled or too young to enter the fray of the battle.  As the warriors themselves refuse to acknowledge this, they have to be ordered into their role by their clan chief."

selectmonster "Barbarian Werebear"
descr "In fact, among the henchmen or retainers composing the bodyguards there are varying degrees of rank conferred by the chief whom they follow, and there is an eager rivalry between the retainers for the post of honor next their chief, as well as between the different chiefs for the honor of having the most numerous and the most valiant bodyguard.  Here lie dignity and strength.  From a surviving slave who managed to flee after serving as a captive for the Barbarian Leader, strange tales about some of these bodyguards have been recorded.  It is said that some of the most honored bodyguards at times of great omens are fetched by some of the oldest Enaries to a sacred place in the forest, where they must crawl through the skin of an old Bear while the priest covers them with tattoos and markings.  Upon returning, their mind is different and they become grumpy and solitary.  It is said that they now are possessed by the spirit of the Bear, and can take that shape during battles.  Some reports have described small tame Bears fighting on the Barbarian side in battles, but nothing indicates that they were once humans."

selectmonster "Mounted Scout"
descr "Being a cunning and sneaky people, the Barbarian Leaders make sure that they keep themselves aware of the whereabouts of approaching armies.  Their forests are filled with Mounted Scouts who move quickly from one place to another, reporting the movement of our armies to the chiefs.  In the Senatorial armies the head of a Mounted Scout fetches such a high price that some soldiers have saved up enough money to buy a Barbarian slave only to dress her up as a scout and then decapitate her."

selectmonster "Elder Enarie"
descr "Few if any outside of the Barbarian tribes, or even within them, have ever seen the Elder Enarie.  Some stories have been told by Barbarian slaves who claim that at this point the Enarie is so addled by communicating with the spirits that they cannot see the real world anymore.  Being confined to a smelly hut, those seeking counsel are first questioned by the younger Enarie and only if the question is deemed grave enough would one be allowed in.  If the leader is fatally ill, a triad of younger Enaries will ask the spirits for names of oathbreakers in the village.  One of those names given will be summoned and thrown into the hut of the Elder Enarie.  If the villager's soul is that of an oathbreaker, the Elder Enarie will strike a brass plate and the now sleeping villager is fetched to be sacrificed for the health of the leader."

selectmonster "Enarie"
descr "Once the Spirit Guide reaches maturity they will be initiated into the deeper mysteries and are no longer forced to eat their monthly herbs.  However, some still do, because it is difficult to end such a habit.  The more powerful ancestral spirits are still driven by a greed for gaudy objects, so the Enarie needs to dress up in shiny accessories.  In order to gain the ability to see the ancient spirits, the Enarie must consume certain strong, poisonous mushrooms that grow near the Troll cesspits.  Without preparation it is far too strong to consume, and could even be fatal to the Enarie.  Instead the mushroom is ground and mixed into strong beer.  The beer is then given to the village drunk, who will readily drink it.  After degrading himself to the amusement of the village, his pee is collected in wooden jars and stored for a week before the enarie drinks it.  The poison is now so diluted as to only give the Enarie strong visions of all the spirits around them."

selectmonster "Spirit Guide"
descr "The Barbarian priests claim that they once learned some of their powers by possessing and consuming an elderly Troll Shaman.  As it regenerated  within the bodies of the Enaries, they managed to use their ancient powers to trap the Troll within them, thus absorbing not only the strange powers of the Troll but also some of its mind.  Ever since this event, the Spirit Guides and Enaries have assumed the role as the Holy Mother of their tribe.  Others claim that the Barbarian tribes were once ruled by a group of holy priestesses that entered a sacred marriage with the Barbarian Leader.  In order to hold on to their power the Spirit Guides have to assume the role of priestesses too, which is why they are now both male and female, both Spirit Speaker and Priestess in the same person.  It is not known if they still keep the tradition of the royal marriage, though. During the full moon the Spirit Guides are given a strong concoction of bitter and poisonous herbs, which gives them sharp pains in their abdomen."

selectmonster "Soothsayer"
descr "To omens and the drawing of lots they pay the very greatest attention.  Soothsayers among the Barbarians are numerous and their method of divining by the lot is simple.  They lop a branch from a fruit tree and cut off the twigs; they mark these differently in order to distinguish them apart, and they then cast them loosely, at haphazard, on a white robe.  Then the priest of the community, if it is going to be a public divination, or if a private one, the head of the household, offers a prayer to the gods, and turning up his eyes to heaven he draws three twigs, one at a time, and he interprets those which he has drawn according to the marks previously set upon them.  If the interpretation proves to be unfavorable, no further divination on the same question takes place that day.  If it is favorable, the auspices have still to be consulted."

selectmonster "Effigy"
descr "Inexperienced merchants travelling the Barbarian realms are sometimes scared by poles from which a dead body stares at them.  Closer studies of these bodies show that they are mere effigies made of human and animal parts, string and old clothing, with just enough magic to hold them together and lure a crow or two there.  As such they must by completely useless and are only made to feed the barbaric superstitions."

selectmonster "Thunder Totem"
descr "Each of the larger villages seems to be protected by a unique statue or decoration carved from a single log of wood.  Quite often they have been standing in the village for a long time and are rotten from the inside, being attacked by mice and woodworms.  The easiest way to subdue a Barbarian village is to smash the totem, as they call it, with something heavy.  Beware of the ones depicting an eagle, as some wings and a skull will shoot out lightning as you do so."

selectmonster "Beast Totem"
descr "Each of the larger village seems to be protected by a unique statue or decoration carved from a single log of wood.  Quite often they have been standing in the village for a long time and are rotten from the inside, being attacked by mice and woodworms.  The easiest way to subdue a Barbarian village is to smash the totem, as they call it, with something heavy.  Beware of the ones depicting the heads of several animals, as they will call wild creatures to their aid as one approaches."

selectmonster "Warrior Totem"
descr "Each of the larger village seems to be protected by a unique statue or decoration carved from a single log of wood.  Quite often they have been standing in the village for a long time and are rotten from the inside, being attacked by mice and woodworms.  The easiest way to subdue a Barbarian village is to smash the totem, as they call it, with something heavy.  Beware of the ones depicting the heads of four different warriors as they will incite the remaining villagers to fight you."

selectmonster "Totem of Maladies"
descr "Each of the larger village seems to be protected by a unique statue or decoration carved from a single log of wood.  Quite often they have been standing in the village for a long time and are rotten from the inside, being attacked by mice and woodworms.  The easiest way to subdue a Barbarian village is to smash the totem, as they call it, with something heavy.  Beware of the ones depicting a smiling demon, as they will most likely afflict you with curse and plague.  Make sure that you bring a slave that can crush it for you."

selectmonster "Giant Snail"
descr "The Giant Snail is an ancient type of creature and some say that this makes it one of the smarter creatures in Elysium.  The Snail is slow and seemingly uninterested in the world, probably thinking of more important matters.  It can spit poison at quite a distance, so be careful not to disturb it."

selectmonster "Black Cat Familiar"
descr "The Cat is useless for just about any task, but for some reason it seems to be attracted to the witch's magic."

selectmonster "Frog"  # also "Frog Familiar"
descr "This Frog is certainly a little larger than your average Frog.  It might even manage to hurt someone with its bite."

selectmonster "Giant Toad"
descr "The bright red skin indicates that this Toad is well respected among the creatures of the swamp.  It can spit poison when it becomes annoyed, but the poison spit is not used for hunting.  Instead the Giant Toad gets all its food by eating mud and fish directly from the swamp water."

selectmonster "Monster Toad"
descr "The Monster Toad is the largest and strongest of all the Toads.  It is also the angriest of the Toads, because despite its size it is not colorful like many of the other Toads and it does not like to be reminded of this."

selectmonster "Marsh Worm"
descr "A very docile beast, the Marsh Worm usually runs away when humans come nearby.  However, if the Marsh Worm is forced to do combat it can be a quite formidable adversary, because it is as large as a horse and has a much nastier bite."

selectmonster "Bog Beast"
descr "A large cold blooded beast that lives in cozy nests in the swamps.  The Bog Beast likes to collect twigs, branches and shiny objects from which it builds its nest.  The female Bog Beast usually lies in the nest and keeps the eggs safe from less honorable swamp creatures.  To get food the Bog Beast uses its highly accurate poison spit to shoot down insects, of which there are plenty of in the swamps."

selectmonster "Swamp Monster"
descr "The Swamp Monster loves swimming and sleeping.  It can often be seen swimming in a muddy pond or just dozing off in the swamp.  People should beware of approaching it however, because like most monsters it is aggressive and attacks humans whenever it gets the chance."

selectmonster "Swamp Thing"
descr "The Swamp Thing is a piece of swamp that has been brought to life with the help of magic.  It is very difficult to destroy and will just reform again unless it is destroyed properly."

selectmonster "Swamp Ghost"
descr "Swamps are magic places and when someone dies in a swamp it is important to take proper measures to prevent the dead from rising later on.  The Swamp Ghost is the spirit of a person who has died in the swamp without being staked properly."

selectmonster "Slime Mold"
descr "Sometimes pieces of swamp debris cling together to and start to grow by absorbing residual magic.  The larger heaps behave almost as if alive and are known as Slime Molds."

selectmonster "Creeping Doom"
descr "The Creeping Doom is a huge cloud consisting of flying bugs.  The cloud of bugs moves quite slowly but destroys everything it its way.  The bugs cannot be fought with ordinary swords and spears as smashing a few bugs would not make a difference."

selectmonster "Hydra"  # also "Hydra Hatchling", "Ancient Hydra"
descr "Hydras live in swamps and are well known for their regenerative properties.  You can even cut off a head and it will grow back moments later.  The Hydra is surrounded by a cloud of poison, most likely as a way to keep all the annoying swamp insects away.  The Hydra's many heads indicate that it eats small creatures like birds and lizards and thus needs to have many heads to satisfy its hunger in a reasonable time."

selectmonster "Crocodile"  # also "Giant Crocodile"
descr "The Crocodile is a slow moving and regal beast.  It usually floats in the muddy swamp waters and only opens its mouth when it wants someone to devour.  If you see a Crocodile open its mouth you are expected to approach it.  If you don't, the Crocodile will be enraged and charge with great speed and ferocity."

selectmonster "Gelatinous Cube"
descr "A strange and almost invisible creature, which, if it didn't like to eat people, no one would know that it was cube shaped.  When attacked by the cube, the victim suddenly notices that it cannot move and then slowly starts to dissolve into the cube.  The dissolving process makes the cube get a wee bit blood colored, this is what makes it possible to see its real shape.  But after a few minutes the color is cleared and the cube is invisible once again."

selectmonster "Will o'the Wisp"
descr "Do not look upon the dancing lights in the swamps.  If you do you'll be entranced and wander off into the swamp, never to be seen again."

selectmonster "Doppelganger"  # also "Doppelganger Captain", "Doppel Spawn"
descr "A Doppelganger can take just about any shape, yet it seems to really like shapes with many tentacles.  The most reasonable explanation for this is that the Doppelganger is some kind of land octopus and thus using tentacles in combat comes naturally.   Unlike the victims of ordinary octopuses, those killed by the Doppelganger's tentacles will transform into small heaps with many tentacles."

selectmonster "Swamp Drake"
descr "Swamp Drakes are large scaly reptiles that are covered in long poisonous spines.  While the spines are excellent as protection against drake eating swamp monsters, they prevent the drake from hunting among bushes and trees where the spikes would get stuck.  Instead the Swamp Drake just swims around slowly in the swamp and breathes poison gas on swarms of insects and eats them in great quantities."

selectmonster "Ancient Presence"
descr "In the old times, a name was whispered in the swamps and anyone entering would hear it and run away in terror.  Such was the power of this Presence that his name was enough to put terror into people.  Now the Presence is weak after a long sleep, but everyone still remembers its name.  They had simply forgotten it until now and wish they could forget it once again."

selectmonster "Catoblepas"
descr "The Catoblepas is one of the most horrible beasts of an ancient time.  The presence of the Catoblepas is poison and its gaze is death."

selectmonster "Wyrm"
descr "The Wyrm is an enormous serpent with both great strength and cunning.  It likes to spray acid on its prey and have it dissolve to the proper degree before eating it."

selectmonster "Swamp God"
descr "A real swamp dwelling horror from the ancient times.  Not much is known about the Swamp God, but it is rumored to be placated by the sacrifices of living beings."

selectmonster "Dracolion"
descr "The front part of a Giant Lion and the rear part of a small Dragon, the Dracolion is a fearsome beast.  It seems to have got the personality from its Dragon part as it prefers to lie in slimy swamps instead of on top of sand dunes.  Also in line with the Dragon's personality, it likes to breathe poison on anything that moves, something that a normal Lion would never bother with."

selectmonster "Androphag Spearman"  # also "Androphag Archer", "Androphag Cavalry", "Androphag Lord"
descr "The manners of the Androphagi are more savage than those of any other human race.  They don't observe justice and only respect those who are stronger than themselves.  They are nomads and while their dress may look normal, the language which they speak is peculiar to them.  Unlike any civilized people and like most beasts of Elysium, they eat humans."

selectmonster "Manflayer"
descr "It is said the Manflayer is the only one who knows the art of flaying humans and turning their skin into something useful.  However, in reality it is his apprentices who do most of the time consuming work of creating human leather.  The Manflayer is often looked down upon and no one would want to become one.  But no sane man would say this to the Manflayer's face as he is also a skilled and often quite mad Necromancer."

selectmonster "Hag"  # also "Witch", "Witch's Apprentice"
descr "It is often deemed wise to root out Witches from the villages while they are still young.  Because should they master the art of Witchcraft, they will become very powerful and might just turn the entire population into pigs.  When they are still young, they are not powerful at all and there are several good methods to find out who is a Witch.  One popular way is to antagonize the girl suspect and if you later become sick you can be pretty sure she is a Witch, because a Witch is always vengeful."

selectmonster "Bog Witch"
descr "When the Witch died, her soul formed a new body from the swamp where her lifeforce was still strong enough to manipulate matter.  By dying the Witch picked up some traits from the dead and is now more powerful than ever.  Should the Bog Witch be slain, she will simply reform her body in another swamp and live on yet another time.  The only way to slay her is to cleanse all swamps from the Witch's influence and then slay her, no easy task."

selectmonster "Rootmonster"
descr "This monster has risen from dead branches, twigs and roots.  The Rootmonster is large but it isn't too bright and can only be commanded to do the simplest of tasks."

selectmonster "Warlock's Apprentice"
descr "Warlocks are mages of limited power who study Elemental Magic.  Due to their limited scope of understanding, they usually surrender to, rather than harness, the magic of the elements.  Any wise practitioner of the magic arts can see that this invariably leads to tragic results.  When a young mage meets a powerful Warlock, he might believe that the powers of the Warlock are his own, but in reality they are borrowed or lent from the Elemental Lords.  When the young apprentice has gained a little knowledge, he is able to form pacts with the elements and summon elemental beings to serve him.  But in order to gain more powers, the Warlock must form a pact with one of the elements, rejecting the opposite Element.  This clearly shows how limited the arcane understanding of the Warlock is."

selectmonster "Warlock of Fire"  # also "Warlock of Water", "Warlock of Air", "Warlock of Earth"
descr "Warlocks are uneducated second class mages who study Elemental Magic.  To gain magical powers, they make pacts with the Elemental Lords.  But Warlocks are not true mages and the powers gained from these pacts are limited.  Since the Elemental Lords are at constant war, it is impossible to form powerful pacts with more than one of the elements.  The pact will limit what elemental beings a Warlock can summon and many Warlocks use apprentices with weak pacts to compensate.  The apprentices are taught how to make lesser pacts and summon elementals opposite of the element of their master.  If a Warlock signs a greater pact with an Elemental Lord, he will lose the ability to cast any rituals except from his chosen element."

selectmonster "Great Warlock of Fire"  # also "Great Warlock of Water", "Great Warlock of Air", "Great Warlock of Earth"
descr "The Great Warlock is a power to be reckoned with, despite his limited arcane understanding.  Given vast powers by his Elemental Lord, but immature of mind, he is likely to wreak havoc and wanton destruction upon civilized men.  Therefore it would be prudent to put any aspiring Warlock to the stake before he can muster enough power to form such a pact.  The fact that the Great Warlock can no longer cast rituals of the other elements has led some of them to form conclaves of Warlocks who serve different elements.  Fortunately there is still a strong animosity between the elemental forces, if not between the Warlocks themselves."

selectmonster "Water Elemental"  # also "Earth Elemental", "Air Elemental", "Fire Elemental"
descr "Elementals are beings of pure elemental energy given life through magical rituals.  The energies used to create the Elemental fade when it is damaged and it will never heal."

selectmonster "Lesser Water"  # also "Lesser Earth", "Lesser Fire", "Cloud Elemental"
descr "Elementals are beings of pure elemental energy given life through magical rituals.  Sometimes the elemental energies used to create the elemental are diluted and impure.  This results in one or several elemental shards or lesser elementals.  The energies used to create an elemental fade when it is damaged and it will never heal."

selectmonster "Champion of Flames"
descr "The Champion of Flames is a being native to the Elemental Plane of Fire.  It manifests as an armored knight mounted on a flaming steed.  The champion can cast pyromantic spells and summon elementals."

selectmonster "Champion of Waves"
descr "The Champion of Waves is a being native to the Elemental Plane of Water.  It manifests as an armored knight mounted on an azure steed of water and kelp.  The champion can cast hydromantic spells and summon elementals.  It can enter the sea."

selectmonster "Champion of Storms"
descr "The Champion of Storms is a being native to the Elemental Plane of Air.  It manifests as an armored knight mounted on a flying steed.  The champion can conjure winds and lightning and summon elementals."

selectmonster "Champion of Mountains"
descr "The Champion of Mountains is a being native to the Elemental Plane of Earth.  It manifests as an armored knight mounted on a stony steed.  The champion can cast geomantic spells and summon elementals."

selectmonster "Yeti"
descr "Yetis are reclusive beings that haunt remote and snow-covered mountaintops.  They are attuned to cold and are surrounded by an icy wind that will freeze those who strikes the Yeti."

selectmonster "Wheel of Frost and Flames"
descr "The Wheel of Frost and Flames is an otherworldly entity of elemental power.  It is a paradoxical conglomerate of opposite elements conjoined into a superior elemental unity.  The Wheels of Frost and Flames are believed to guard the Primal Gates that connect the elemental planes."

selectmonster "Wheel of Storm and Stone"
descr "The Wheel of Storm and Stone is an otherworldly entity of elemental power.  It is a paradoxical conglomerate of opposite elements conjoined into a superior elemental unity.  The Wheels of Storm and Stone are believed to guard the Primal Gates that connect the elemental planes."

selectmonster "Phoenix"
descr "The Phoenix is a heavenly bird sprung from the Elemental Plane of Fire.  It appears as a great heron endowed with solar splendor.  The Phoenix is immortal.  Should it meet with death, it will immolate itself in a blazing pyre and be reborn at it's master's citadel."

selectmonster "Salamander"
descr "The Salamander is a large, lizardlike being with a burning body and poisonous fangs.  It might originate from the Plane of Elemental Fire, but if so, it is the only known poisonous being from that realm.  Whatever its origin, the Salamander sometimes serves Warlocks and other elemental entities."

selectmonster "Flame Spirit"
descr "According to most scholars, the Flame Spirit is an entity native to the Elemental Plane of Fire.  It is sentient and a powerful wielder of fiery magic.  Flame Spirits are sometimes found in deserts and near volcanoes where their element is strong.  No gates into their home plane have yet been encountered, which leads to the conclusion that the spirits somehow spontaneously spawn from intense heat.  This is a bothersome thought, since it would imply that concentration of other elements or even wild forests could develop conscience or something akin to a soul."

selectmonster "Frost Drake"
descr "The Frost Drake is a large, lizardlike being with a numbingly cold body and an icy breath.  It might originate from the Elemental planes, but if so, it has since adapted to life in Elysium.  Whatever its origin, the Frost Drake sometimes serves Warlocks and other elemental entities."

selectmonster "Thunderbird"
descr "The Thunderbird is a heavenly bird sprung from the Elemental Plane of Air.  It appears as a great bald eagle with gathering storm clouds underneath its wings.  The Thunder Bird was worshipped as a herald of storms and justice in ancient times, but now when its origin is known, they are more commonly summoned and bound by mighty Warlocks."

selectmonster "Sylph"
descr "Sylphs are spirit entities native to the Elemental Plane of Air.  They are in many ways similar to Flame Spirits, but they seem to be more social and there are even stories where curious Sylphs have befriended human peasants.  Like other elemental spirits, they can manipulate their element and cast spells of protection or destruction."

selectmonster "Undine"
descr "Undines are spirit entities native to the Elemental Plane of Water.  Undines are in many ways similar to the other elemental spirits.  They are rarely encountered in Elysium, but they are not uncommon in fishermen's stories.  Some scholars suspect that Undines are not as uncommon as we think.  Undines, like Sylphs, are social beings.  In contact with humans they can be nurturing, or even on the verge of smothering.  Several stories tell of fishermen drowning in their loving arms."

selectmonster "Earth Gnome"
descr "Earth Gnomes are spirit entities native to the Elemental Plane of Earth.  Gnomes are in many ways similar to the other elemental spirits.  They are rarely encountered in Elysium, but they are not uncommon in miner's stories where they might cause cave-ins or lead a miner to pockets of gold and gemstones. Earth Gnomes, like Flame Spirits, are rarely encountered in groups, but they are not aggressively asocial. Instead they have a brooding nature and seem to prefer solitude."

selectmonster "Stone Drake"
descr "Stone Drakes are great, lizardlike beings with hardy flesh and a stony carapace.  It is closely attuned to the earth and some scholars claim that they originate from the Elemental Plane of Earth.  Regardless of their origin, they can be bound by Elemental magic."

selectmonster "Fire Giant"
descr "The most powerful inhabitants of the Elemental Plane of Fire are the Fire Giants, primordial beings of tremendous strength.  As warriors and guardians of their fiery realm, they wield flaming swords imbued with elemental power.  They live in castles of bricks and bronze, surrounded by moats of molten metal, and only leave their abodes to wage war upon the other elemental realms.  Like all inhabitants of the realm of Fire, the Fire Giants giants have difficulties entering the Planes of Water and Ice, but should they meet denizens of those realms in Elysium, they are likely to attack on sight."

selectmonster "Frost Giant"
descr "In the farthest reaches of the Elemental Plane of Water lies an icy realm of unforgiving cold.  Here live the Frost Giants, primordial beings of tremendous strength.  As warriors and guardians of their frozen realm, they wield cold as a weapon.  They live in castles of iron and ice, and only leave their abodes to wage war upon the other elemental realms.  Like all inhabitants of the realm of Water, the Frost Giants have difficulties entering the Plane of Fire, but should they meet denizens of that realm in Elysium, they are likely to attack on sight."

selectmonster "Storm Giant"
descr "The most powerful inhabitants of the Elemental Plane of Air are the Storm Giants, primordial beings of tremendous strength.  As warriors and guardians of their stormy realm, they wield lightning as a weapon.  They live in lofty cloud castles, and only leave their abodes to wage war upon the other elemental realms.  Like all inhabitants of the realm of Air, Storm Giants have difficulties entering the Plane of Earth, but should they meet denizens of that realm in Elysium, they are likely to attack on sight."

selectmonster "Mountain Giant"
descr "The most powerful inhabitants of the Elemental Plane of Earth are the Mountain Giants, primordial beings of tremendous strength.  They are warriors and master smiths and wield mighty hammers in war and in peace.  They live in opulent halls adorned with gems and gold, and only leave their abodes to wage war upon the other elemental realms.  Like all inhabitants of the realm of Earth, Mountain Giants have difficulties entering the Plane of Air, but should they meet denizens of that realm in Elysium, they are likely to attack on sight."

selectmonster "Sea Giant"
descr "The most powerful inhabitants of the Elemental Plane of Water are the Sea Giants, primordial beings of tremendous strength.  They are warriors and guardians of their watery realm and wield enchanted tridents in battle.  They live in coral castles and only leave their abodes to wage war upon the other elemental realms.  Like all inhabitants of the realm of Water, Sea Giants have difficulties entering the Plane of Fire, but should they meet such beings in Elysium, they are likely to attack on sight."

selectmonster "Pale One Commander"
descr "The Pale Ones seems to have a rudimentary understanding of hierarchy, apart from the instinctive animal behavior to follow the largest member of the pack.  Some Pale Ones are armed with weapons made of iron, but their equipment is otherwise similar to the bronze armaments of the Pale One soldiers.  This has several implications.  First, that they have managed to trade and communicate with other races, most likely dwarves.  Secondly, they have learned the arts of ironcrafting.  This changes in many ways how we look upon the slow-witted Pale Ones.  The use of iron and the implications of hierarchical order are also far beyond earlier preconceptions of the Pale Ones' capabilities.  The Pale Ones clearly follow their iron-clad commanders.  It is possible that these commanders are gifted with a shard of Olmic legacy, but there are some scholars who actually ascribe all Pale Ones a working, albeit inferior, mind."

selectmonster "Pale One"
descr "Much like apes have devolved from humans, scholars have claimed that the Pale Ones are degenerate Olms.  The proud Olmic race lives in dark caverns under the Roots of the Earth.  While Olms are blind, they are gifted with superior minds and the ability to sense their surroundings as well as the minds of others.  How the Pale Ones devolved from the Olms is not known, but closeness to the surface world and the influence of foul magic seems likely.  The Pale Ones are a strange race of one-eyed humanoid Olms.  Grossly fat, one-eyed and bereft of deeper intellect, it is clear they were not meant to be.  Untouched by the sun, they have become known to us as the Pale Ones.  They are gifted with perfect darkvision and gills, but their single eye is inferior to even the eyes of fish.  The Pale Ones, like their Olm ancestors, inhabit underwater rivers and lakes as well as cavern halls."

selectmonster "Pale One Scout"
descr "Even an inferior race devolved from intelligent worms can see the need of good information.  How the Pale One Scouts manage to perform their task is still a mystery, considering the limits of their one eye.  There are indications that some spark of the Olmic mind still resides in the brains of the Pale Ones.  If so, it is possible that the Pale One scouts are gifted individuals with abilities to sense minds in their vicinity.  However, it is more likely that they use their affinity for slow movements in the dark to avoid detection while observing enemies with their big black eye."

selectmonster "Pale One Soldier"
descr "The Pale Ones are as lacking in warcraft as they are in culture.  Most of their soldiers use arms and armor made of bronze and cave cow leather.  That ironworking hasn't been discovered by a race living in the depths of the earth clearly shows how inferior they are to most other cave dwelling races.  Dwarves in particular stand out as an example of a race of extraordinary cultural stature, where craftsmanship, collective building endeavors and runic lore have been perfected for millennia."

selectmonster "Cavern Guard"
descr "The Cavern Guards are the elites of the Pale Ones.  Their armor is heavier and they use long bronze glaives that can strike with surprising effect.  The Cavern Guards had previously never been encountered, except in dwarven accounts, but with the recent attack on a remote iron mine there was a large contingent of glaive-wielding guards that prevented our forces from entering the mine while some strange ritual was performed in the depths.  When the Cavern Guards finally retreated there was a rumbling in the mountain and most of our army was buried in an avalanche.  While most would assume that the Pale Ones do not have the mental faculties to form social groups and hierarchies, the presence of the Cavern Guards clearly show that even a backward race of grub-men will evolve if exposed to the culture of other races."

selectmonster "Earth Reader"
descr "The Earth Readers are the religious leaders of the Pale Ones.  They are the keepers of Pale One traditions and even the Ancient Ones seems to follow their advice.  The lack of culture and religious understanding previously attributed to the Pale Ones has not taken the Earth Readers into account.  The existence of the Earth Readers shows that the Pale Ones have formed a hierarchical society based not only on physical strength, but on control of beliefs and tradition.  The Earth Readers have unearthed magical lore and according to some sources they may even surpass dwarven understanding of magic, although that is more or less damning with faint praise.  If there are ancient Pale Ones grown to huge proportions, one might speculate on the possibility that there are ancient Earth Readers that have likewise grown in size and magical power."

selectmonster "Earth Mind"
descr "The Earth Minds are Earth Readers of exceptional skill.  Surpassing the dwarven rune-smiths in magical power, they indicate that there are far greater powers in the deeper earth than we had previously thought.  Considering the gemstone riches of the Pale Ones encountered so far, we can only come to the conclusion that the deeper earth holds vast treasures ready to be plucked.  The Earth Mind may get his name from his ability to instill false life in the statues and sentinels littering cavernous halls of the Pale Ones.  Or it may be the honorary title of someone who actually can use his mind."

selectmonster "Ancient Pale One"
descr "The Pale Ones have very long lifespans.  The one captured and held locked up in the dungeon of sir Boyd the Second survived for three generations, despite rough treatment.  It was put to display at the yearly summer festival by the Boyds.  By the time Castle Boyd was destroyed by the foul magics of Ephagina, the beast was so large it could barely be pushed out of its cell.  There are reports of other overgrown Pale Ones, and it is likely that they can survive and grow to become giants if left alone in the deep caverns of the world.  While the captive beast was blind and grossly fat, it is likely that an Ancient Pale One living in its natural habitat would be both strong and clever."

selectmonster "Ancient Commander"
descr "The recent encounters with the Ancient Pale Ones have given us much more understanding on their culture and society.  Early encounters with the race have been with scouts and young ones.  The older the Pale Ones get, the larger they grow, and the more influence they wield.  It is probable, but not certain, that their minds and cunning also grow with age, but the presence of young commanders and magically skilled Earth Readers suggest that most of the Pale Ones are born stupid and never develop higher mental faculties, while a few are born with the skills to lead or learn magic.  When such individuals grow old they will invariably become leaders of their brethren."

selectmonster "Ancient Hurler"
descr "The Ancient Pale Ones are remarkably strong, despite their pale, flabby flesh.  Without easy access to wood, and limited understanding of metallurgy, the Pale Ones have never used ranged weapons apart from thrown rocks.  But the size and strength of the Ancient Ones allow them to throw not just rocks, but boulders the size of Hoburgers."

selectmonster "Oracle of Subterranean Fires"  # also "Oracle of Rhuax"
descr "Unknown even to the Dwarves, if information gathered from captured Dwarven scouts can be trusted, the Oracles of the Deeper Earth seem to be the true leaders of the Pale Ones.  Just as the regular Pale Ones grow into huge beasts, their Earth Reader soothsayers must grow in size and power over the centuries.  The corpse of a remarkably huge and fat Pale One adorned with jewelry was found after a battle in which avalanches and magmatic eruptions wiped out part of our army and almost defeated our attack.  Only with the aid of the Adepts of the Iron Order was the battle won, and the Pale Ones defeated.  The Pale One veneration of subterranean fires attested to by dwarven informants suggests that there are Ancient Oracles who have learned Pyromancy as well as Geomantic spells."

selectmonster "Oracle of Subterranean Waters"  # also "Oracle of Apsu"
descr "Unknown even to the Dwarves, if information gathered from captured Dwarven scouts can be trusted, the Oracles of the Deeper Earth seem to be the true leaders of the Pale Ones.  Just as the regular Pale Ones grow into huge beasts, their Earth Reader soothsayers must grow in size and power over the centuries.  An explorer of the deeper earth, claiming to own an elven cloak and the friendship of dwarves, however unlikely, recently told a tale of a Conclave of Olms consulting with a huge and grossly fat Pale One adorned with jewelry.  The Pale One veneration of Olms and subterranean waters attested to by dwarven informants suggests that there are Ancient Oracles who have learned Hydromancy as well as Geomantic spells."

selectmonster "Oracle of the Dead"  # also "Oracle of Allatu"
descr "Unknown even to the Dwarves, if information gathered from captured Dwarven scouts can be trusted, the Oracles of the Deeper Earth seem to be the true leaders of the Pale Ones.  Just as the regular Pale Ones grow into huge beasts, their Earth Reader soothsayers must grow in size and power over the centuries.  Recently we discovered a huge, cavernous tomb filled with mummified dead, gold and gems.  Meditating in the inner chamber was a huge and grossly fat Pale One, adorned with jewelry.  It was swiftly disposed of after having its eye pierced by a bolt from the Vision's Foe carried by our proud commander.  The Pale One veneration of the Dead attested to by dwarven informants suggests that there are Ancient Oracles who have learned Necromancy as well as Geomantic spells."

selectmonster "Troglodyte"
descr "Troglodytes are large cavern-dwelling beasts rarely found on the surface world.  They have their mouth and some bright green organs thought to be their eyes in the middle of their chest.  Troglodytes have strangely rat-like tails and fur.  Some scholars claim that they are in fact corrupted and overgrown rats.  If so, there may be a powerful corrupting force in the deeper caverns of the world.  The preferred food of Troglodytes is not known, but they do welcome the occasional human as a snack.  Troglodytes have been encountered in the armies of the Pale Ones and it is likely that they breed the Troglodytes like dogs of war."

selectmonster "Sentinel"
descr "The caverns of the Pale Ones are littered with statues and sculptures.  Every passage is guarded by silent watchers staring at intruders with a stony cyclops eye.  Only surprise and shock can describe the reactions of the first explorers to encounter the living Sentinels of the deeper earth.  It is still not known how the dim-witted Pale Ones have managed the magical feat of reanimating the Sentinels.  Theories range from necromantic possession to pacts with elemental beings.  Most of these theories assume that the Pale Ones themselves are not capable of giving the Sentinels life.  This position is flawed and may prove disastrous in the future.  Recently a castle at our borders was retaken from the Pale Ones.  The gates were defended by living statues almost impervious to our swords, but fortunately the Pale Ones were unable to field missile troops, and eventually the statues were smashed and the castle was liberated."

selectmonster "Granite Guardian"
descr "While untrustworthy reports have claimed that the very statues of the Pale Ones are alive, we had never considered the possibility that the Pale Ones could reanimate statues the size of giants.  When the Dwarves found a new colony, they raise walls and build sturdy gates to protect their home.  The Pale Ones are less industrious, but they boast magical powers surpassing dwarven skills.  In several mines recently wrested from the Pale Ones, statues of huge Pale Ones walking side by side with their living models wreaked havoc on our soldiers.  Fortunately the Granite Guardians seem reluctant to leave their posts, so a full scale invasion of living stone giants is unlikely."

selectmonster "Onyx Oracle"  # also "Marble Oracle"
descr "The Pale Ones venerate their dead and prominent ones receive honors and are commemorated through statues placed in tunnels and gates.  These statues are known to be animated by the Earth Readers.  Recently there was an encounter with a living statue of a huge and jeweled Pale One thought to be an Oracle of the Deeper Earth.  That the statue moved and fought was a bit shocking to our troops, but more so was the fact that the abomination used magic to defend its living kin.  Dwarven reports are now revisited and tales of lumbering stone oracles leading the Pale Ones in prayer might give us new insights into the cultic practices of the Pale Ones.  Presumably the Marble Oracles are reanimated by the memories of their former selves, but this possibility will remain unconfirmed until a specimen has been captured.  Other suggestions regarding the magic skills of the statues include necromantic possession and sealed enchantments."

selectmonster "Penumbral"
descr "Shades and ghosts are what remains of a person when the body has died and they are thought to be the spirit or soul of the person.  Some scholars argue that they are just manifest memories, but that can be easily refuted by anyone with a brief understanding of Hades.  The Pale Ones are considered to be dumb brutes with mental faculties barely exceeding those of common beasts.  While this might appear to be the case if you try to communicate with them in your own language, it is quite clear that they do indeed have a mind and a soul, albeit inferior to ours.  The Penumbrals are shadowy beings resembling Pale Ones, but their lower soul is manifest and their faces are distorted and prolonged into sucking mouths that feed on the lifeforce of living beings. These strange shades have been encountered in Pale One armies and suggests that the Pale Ones have mastered not only Geomantic spells, but also the dark arts of Necromancy."

selectmonster "Umbral"
descr "The Pale Ones seem to be accomplished Necromancers as well as masters of elemental magic.  The dark spirits of the ancient dead have been encountered on several occasions.  Worst of these abominations are the Umbrals, huge spectres resembling Ancient Pale Ones with prolonged faces ending in sucking mouths.  It is not known if the spirits of dead Pale Ones grow like the living ones, or if the larger Umbrals are the spirits or memories of ancient ones.  To date there are no records of magically adept Umbrals, so there might be some truth to the Dwarven claims that only weak souls that are easily corrupted return as Umbrals.  Dwarven lore also suggests that there is a Cavern of Deeper Shadow somewhere, a dread place where Umbrals reign."

selectmonster "Seal Guard"
descr "Somewhere in the deeper reaches of the earth there is rumored to be a sealed chamber.  Dwarven lore on the matter is limited, but more comprehensive than the few tidbits gathered from explorers, goblins and captured Pale Ones.  It is clear that some of the Ancient Pale Ones are given exceptional training and weapons made from enchanted obsidian.  The Dwarves claim that they are called Seal Guards by the Pale Ones and that most of them leave their home and wander to the deepest reaches of the earth on a holy quest when their training is done.  We have only encountered a few of these armored giants, and we have never captured one alive, so the mysteries remain.  The recent addition of a thought-reader to the Royal Inquisitive Order is supposed to bring clarity to the matter.  Unfortunately it would seem the thought-reader was read himself, while questioning an Olm prisoner.^What is known of the Seal Guard is that they are supposed to guard the Sealed Chamber with enchanted weapons to prevent 'corrupted souls' from spreading.  What 'corrupted souls' means we can only speculate."

selectmonster "King of the Deep"
descr "Oldest among a race of ancient beings, the King of the Deep is prophesied to lead the Pale Ones in conquest of Elysium, and die a martyr's death in the process.^We have been told by the Dwarves that the lore concerning the future of the Pale Ones is limited, but it would seem that the Pale Ones themselves put a lot of trust in foretellings and readings of fate.  This should be expected from a race with a lengthy lifespan and slow wits.  The King of the Deep was until recently just a myth, but some time ago one of our mines was attacked by an army of Pale Ones led by a tremendously large, bronze-armored giant.  The Pale Ones were thought to be peaceful, albeit protective of their homes, like badgers, but this new development indicates that there is a new will stirring in the halls of the deeper earth.  If it is the emergence of the King or if some even more sinister power is at work we do not know.  One way or another, the King must be linked to the recent aggression of the Pale Ones."

selectmonster "Cavern Wight"
descr "The Pale Ones have long lifespans and they seem to fear and marvel at the concept of death.  Their dead ones are entombed in great halls and statues are made in their image.  The souls of their dead are not as advanced as human souls and therefore do not enter Hades.  Instead the memories and spirits of their dead remain in their mummified bodies.  It was recently discovered that these mummies are reanimated through necromantic rituals.  Since the souls of the dead remain in their mummified bodies, the revenants retain memory and purpose and are considered part of the Pale One society.  It is even likely that the Cavern Wight gets more respect and status than its living kin."

selectmonster "Sepulchral"
descr "According to Dwarven lore, there is a sealed chamber somewhere in the deeper reaches of the earth.  It is supposed to be guarded by Ancient Pale Ones armed with glaives with obsidian heads.  During our recent excavation of a sealed cave we found a vast tomb filled with statues and mummified corpses of Pale Ones of different sizes.  In the deepest part of the tomb was an area where huge mummified Pale Ones in bronze armor and carrying obsidian glaives laid staring at the ceiling above.  With the newly gained insight that Pale One practices Necromancy, it is not unlikely that the mummified corpses of these giants are also reanimated.  If so, they must have superior knowledge of the deeper earth and should be captured and interrogated by a loyal Necromancer who is able to communicate with the dead.  Since the Pale Ones are known to have limited mental faculties, and therefore weak souls, this should prove an easy task, once a loyal Necromancer has been found."

selectmonster "Tomb Oracle"
descr "When the seal to the third tomb was broken it was clear that it was something special.  The walls and pillars were adorned with gemstones, crystals and rare metals.  Life-like statues and mummified corpses littered the place.  In an inner chamber there were thrones of onyx and lapis lazuli on which sat mummies of bloated Pale Ones draped in jewelry.  We have heard rumors of Oracles of the Deep, ancient Earth Readers with great powers.  Now we can be certain that at least in earlier times there were such ancient Oracles.  The discovery is worrisome.  Its implications are that the legendary Oracles do exist and are possibly still present in the deeper reaches of the earth.  It might also mean that necromantic arts can be used to reanimate these entombed oracles and tap their ancient knowledge and power.  To prevent any unforeseen events we quickly disposed of the mummified giants we found with fire and vitriol."

selectmonster "Cave Grub"
descr "The ancestry of the Pale Ones is much disputed. Either they are devolved Olms, or evolved Cave Grubs.  Those of us who believe that the Pale Ones are conscious and have a will would place them in the first category.  Cave Grubs resemble the grubs found in dirt and dung all over Elysium, only bigger.  Grubs have a multitude of small feet, but no apparent prehensile appendages.  Olms on the other hand have four prehensile limbs.  Pale Ones resemble humans, in that they have arms with hands and legs with feet.  They are clearly closer to Olms than grubs in this regard.  Furthermore, Cave Grubs produce a highly corrosive saliva, which again do neither Olms, nor Pale Ones.  It should be noted that the Pale Ones herd the beasts and use them as tunnelers and excavators of their deep-earth kingdoms.  Finally, the grub is blind and orients itself through unknown means.  The Olm is also blind, but some organs resembling eyes can be found on the sides of their heads.  Pale Ones are cyclopean, but a change from two eyes to one is less far fetched than getting a new one where there was none.  So we must conclude that the Pale Ones truly are a species of degenerate Olms."

selectmonster "Cave Cow"
descr "Cave Cows are strange beings of the deeper earth, that feed on fungi and minerals.  Its saliva is highly corrosive and can dissolve rock and minerals.  While most scholars adhere to either the Olm theory or the Grub theory, Troglofilius suggested that the Pale Ones were created together with the Cave Cows, and did not evolve from Olms nor Grubs.  This would suggest a mad creator god and Troglofilius' theories are refuted by most sane scholars.  To prove his theory right, the late scholar embarked upon an expedition through the lands of the Pale Ones.  According to the only survivor of the expedition, Troglofilius died when an annoyed Cave Cow spit him in the face as the scholar tried to collect samples from the specimen."

selectmonster "Olm Sage"  # also "Olm Farseer", "Olm"
descr "Olms are an ancient race of wormlike beings gifted with superior intelligence and a mind that extends beyond its body, according to Pyrrho.  The Olms have lived in the water-filled caverns of the deeper earth since the dawn of time.  They are a proud race with an incomparable history.  Since every Olm can sense and partake in the mind of the Conclave, the social grouping of the Olms, their history is never forgotten and grows with every meeting of two conclaves.  However, regardless of the vastness of their history, we imagine that it would easily fit in a short book or two.  The Olms have never left the underearth and most of their history would probably be recordings of the frequency of dripping water in their dismal caverns.  An interesting fact regarding the Olmic race, apart from their long history, is that the Olms are considered to be the forefathers of the Pale Ones.  Since we don't have access to the historical records of the Olmic Conclaves, we cannot be sure of this.  Troglofilus tried to dissect a number of Olms to see if it was possible to map their history through their brains, and thereby prove that the Pale Ones have nothing in common with the Olms.  His experiments failed, but he did prove that the red feather-like appendages surrounding the neck of the Olms are not external brains, but gills."

selectmonster "Purple Worm"
descr "The Purple Worms are truly gigantic in size and they eat the only thing that is available in the quantities needed to sustain such a huge thing, earth.  The worms are seldom seen despite their size, because they spend all their time deep below the surface of Elysium.  However those visiting the deep earth cannot miss the work of the worms as they walk in the vast empty caves left in the wake of the enormous worms.  Modern research proves that it was the Purple Worms that ate the parts that later became Inferno.  The devils settling there forced the worms to move closer to Elysium, where they currently reside and are likely to do so until something very powerful wants their newly created caverns for itself."

selectmonster "Cultist"
descr "Demonologists do not recruit their apprentices from among the students at the Academy.  Instead, they find them among the novices at the temples.  There are two reasons for this.  First, novices tend to be more careful and therefore more suited to the task.  Second, most apprentices die early and recruiting them from a temple is much easier and prevents the many deaths from upsetting the other orders of magic."

selectmonster "Demonologist"
descr "Some think Demonologists are brave, mad and daring, but it is really the opposite.  A brave Demonologist would die quickly as an apprentice, and only a very cautious man survives long enough to become a fully fledged Demonologist.  It can be debated whether Demonology should be allowed at all, because the risk of dealing with the Inferno might outweigh the possible benefits of doing so.  However, properly controlled demons have proved to be of great use when fighting the wildlife and if demons and beasts can kill each other, then life will be easier for everyone."

selectmonster "Goetic Master"
descr "Those dealing with the Inferno have a great responsibility to not let any Infernal Powers gain a foothold in Elysium.  An apprentice will probably only manage to kill himself, but a Goetic Master has the power to destroy Elysium if he should mess up badly.  Luckily, Demonologists are known to die early in case they are not very cautious individuals."

selectmonster "Imp Familiar"
descr "Cultists often start their career by summoning and binding an Imp Familiar.  They are easy to bind and not too dangerous if the cultist should fail with the ritual.  The familiar is also more useful than most demons and can handle real tasks such as sweeping the floor and washing stained robes."

selectmonster "Imp"  # also "Shadow Imp", "Fiery Imp", "Ice Imp", "Bone Imp", "Imp Messenger"
descr "Imps come in all manner of types and colors.  Some are capable of casting spells and very useful in combat.  Some are less useful in combat but make good scouts.  Some are just useless and only want to kill things even though they are lousy at it."

selectmonster "Harlequin"
descr "Crueler beings than humans enjoy a good laugh.  Demon jesters, or Harlequins, are lowly devils forced to entertain the Infernal Lords.  The entertainment includes chopping off limbs, the occasional poke in the eye as well as protracted torture.  Thus many Harlequins are seriously crippled and most are quite happy to leave the Inferno.  They appear as distorted hunchbacks with flapping wings.  Their heads are huge and have protruding noses and chins.  Demon jesters are more appalling than frightening to behold."

selectmonster "Sinner"
descr "In the eyes of the Infernal Lords, everyone is a sinner.  These ones were just unlucky enough to draw the attention of the Infernal Powers.  Sinners captured by devils should be killed if possible.  This will spare them much suffering as well as depriving Inferno from the opportunity to use the power of the sinners to bolster their forces."

selectmonster "Hellhound"
descr "The hounds from the Inferno seem to hate humans and thus they are quite similar in behavior to the regular beasts living in Elysium.  The major difference is that the Hellhound is attuned to the Inferno and can sometimes appear instead of a demon when a Demonologist attempts a summoning.  Luckily Hellhounds can be bound by the same magic that is used to bind demons."

selectmonster "Demonic Locust"
descr "Demonic Locusts are harbingers of Armageddon and heralds of the Demon Lords.  From smoking cracks in the ground they crawl forth to lead the faithful astray and bring turmoil and strife.  They appear as giant locusts with crowned human heads and scales of brass and iron. Their shrill, angelic voices can be heard for miles and their words are those of false prophets and rebellious demagogues."

selectmonster "Disease Demon"
descr "The Disease Demon is a bringer of pestilence and its mere presence causes healthy men to cough and shiver.  It feeds on the prayers and promises given by the despairing victims of its fevers.  Left to its own, the demon will choose to torment humans, but an enterprising Demonologist can force them to be useful and torment beasts and other monstrosities instead."

selectmonster "Serpent Fiend"
descr "Serpents are very devious beasts and some demon lord must have thought that combining a serpent and a demonic fiend would produce an exceedingly cunning demon that could trick humans into parting with their souls.  Fortunately this experiment must have gone wrong, because the Serpent Fiend is quite daft and would only be able to trick a human to part with his garbage.  The Serpent Fiend does possess a very poisonous bite, however, so it can be quite dangerous in a battle."

selectmonster "Devil"
descr "Devils are infernal beings of great strength.  Only with human sacrifice is it possible to summon and bind these evil beings.  Devils are born in the fires of the Inferno and are impervious to heat and flame.  They have glowing red bodies and bat-like wings grow from their shoulders.  Devils are armed with tridents and their barbed tails can sting opponents in close combat."

selectmonster "Frost Fiend"
descr "Inferno is not only a realm of fire and lava.  It also contains endless frozen wastes of snow and ice.  This cold region is called Kokytos and it is where the Frost Fiends are created.  They radiate the cold of Kokytos and kill by ramming their icicle fists into people.  Take care when summoning these evil fiends."

selectmonster "Lesser Demon"
descr "The Lesser Demon was probably meant to be a superior combat demon.  It has many limbs for extra attacks, three legs so it cannot be tripped and its mouth located on its torso so that it can have room for more eyes in the face.  Unsurprisingly, it turned out to be a misfit, even for a demon.  It is less powerful than all but the Imps and therefore it is named Lesser Demon."

selectmonster "Bone Devil"
descr "Bone Devils are the remains of dead Devils that have been reanimated by a demon lord.  The number of Bone Devils that have been seen means that some demon lord kills Devils in large numbers to make Bone Devils out of them.  They are probably more useful that way."

selectmonster "Spine Devil"
descr "Envious of the other devils' ability to fly or to cast spells, the Spine Devils always run as fast as they can when it is time for battle.  They do not want the smug flying and spell casting devils to get all the fun for themselves."

selectmonster "Fiend of Darkness"
descr "The Fiend of Darkness is one of the smarter demons.  It is not as bloodthirsty as most of them and it is capable of blending into the shadows and become almost undetectable.  This is quite a feat for a demon, because most others would instantly attack any living beings they see."

selectmonster "Demon Knight"
descr "Inspired by the technological advances of humankind, the demon lords have created their own army of knights.  This attempt misses all the fine points of being a knight like the noble blood, the honor of the highborn and the well deserved respect from the common people. Instead it is just an ordinary demon in plate armor on an infernal fire breathing steed."

selectmonster "Bloodsworn"
descr "Bloodsworn are humans who have sold their souls and now serve the Infernal forces.  They have been given great strength, but their soul is lost forever."

selectmonster "Storm Demon"
descr "Because the weather gods don't care about making weather in Inferno, that task had to be taken care of by the demons themselves.  The group of demons that took charge of the weather are known as Storm Demons.  Being demons, they enjoy making awful weather like thunderstorms, blizzards and torrential rain."

selectmonster "Succubus"
descr "The Succubus has the shape of a young naked woman and looks remarkably beautiful for a being with wyvern-like wings on her back.  A Succubus is able to enter the dreams of any male to seduce and corrupt his soul.  Only those of the highest moral character will be able to resist the Succubus once she has entered their dreams."

selectmonster "Greater Demon"
descr "Serpent and human crossbreedings are popular among the demons.  Perhaps the Serpent's deviousness is sought after by the demons.  This particular variety seems to have been quite successful, because the demon can move at normal speed despite having the lower body of a giant Serpent.  However, it is still not able to climb and hide like a Serpent, nor does it possess the poisonous bite characteristic of Serpents and Snakes."

selectmonster "Ice Devil"
descr "The Ice Devil is a much more formidable version of the Frost Fiend.  It is both larger and smarter.  Ice Devils resent that they don't have wings to fly with despite having a body suitable for wing attachments.  They really hate the flying fiery Devils and love nothing more than to unleash deadly Frost magic upon them whenever possible."

selectmonster "Greater Devil"
descr "The proudest of all the devils, the Greater Devil loves to fly around and cause the sinners to cower in fear and awe.  Apart from impressing sinners, the Greater Devils also like to uphold discipline among the lesser devils and administer the necessary tortures to keep them in line."

selectmonster "Heliophagus"
descr "The Heliophagus is a devious and sneaky devil, possibly the result of some serpent crossbreeding experiment.  The Heliophagus likes it in the shadows where they are not bothered by anyone.  This makes them look weak in the eyes of the other devils.  However, most devils would be unable to find the Heliophagii, so there is no point in trying in bothering them even though they might be weak."

selectmonster "Lord of Corruption"
descr "'But for corruption thou hast made Belial, an angel of hostility.  All his Dominions are in darkness, and his purpose is to bring about wickedness and guilt.  All the spirits that are associated with him are but angels of destruction.'^Belial is one of the Demon Lords.  The Corruptor of Souls, Belial causes men to do evil and leads them away from virtue."

selectmonster "Demon Lord"
descr "Belphegor is one of the Demon Lords.  He is a seducer of men and uses gold to sow discord.  Fathers sell their sons and daughters to the Demons and his host of corrupted souls is always growing.  The mere existence of Belphegor is the reason that honest people may turn dishonest and sell their loved ones for gold."

selectmonster "Goat Sun"
descr "Buer is one of the Demon Lords.  He is the Sun of the Inferno and tortures sinners and demons alike with searing heat.  Buer appears as a burning, lion-maned goat's head encircled by five goat legs.  The mere presence of the Goat Sun causes the temperature to rise to unbearable levels and in battle anyone who comes near him will be burnt to a crisp.  Buer is a Lesser Sun and bound by divine laws to stay on the ground when visiting Elysium, a fact which he greatly resents."

selectmonster "Monster of Fraud"
descr "Geryon is one of the Demon Lords.  He takes the form of a great wyvern with the paws of a lion and the head of an elderly and honest man.  Geryon is the Monster of Fraud and all souls who cheat and commit fraud are his to claim.  His mere existence is the cause of many honest people becoming selfish and untrustworthy."

selectmonster "Duke of Hell"
descr "Asmodeus, the Duke of Hell, is the self proclaimed ruler of Inferno.  This title is of course disputed by the other demon lords, but Asmodeus is a skillful ruler and is undoubtedly one of the most influential lords in Inferno."

selectmonster "Prince of Death"
descr "Orcus, the Prince of Death, was once a respected lord of the Inferno.  His passion for death led him to kill all the sinners and reanimate them as his undead servants, which was not appreciated by the other demon lords.  After fighting a losing battle against them, Orcus had to flee Inferno and now rules in Hades instead."

selectmonster "Arch Devil"
descr "Abaddon is one of the demon lords and rules the outer reaches of the Inferno.  His body is that of a compact shadow and he is only partly in this world.  Abaddon revels in torturing lesser demons that have not lived up to his standards, or just because they were unlucky this particular day."

selectmonster "Anointed Priestess"
descr "The Anointed Priestess is a High Priestess during whose reign Ba'al will manifest.  Her arrival was foretold in the scriptures and she will call the Giants of Old.  The Anointed Priestess has the power to call primordial beings corrupted by the Dark God."

selectmonster "High Priestess"
descr "The High Priestesses have served Ba'al since the time of Giants, when Ba'al was incarnate on earth.  When Ba'al and the Giants disappeared, the priestesses led the cult in secret for ages.  Now the cult has emerged in the ever-changing lands of Elysium and the priestesses are preparing for the second coming of the dark God."

selectmonster "Hierodule"
descr "The Hierodule is a priestess of Ba'al.  Being married to her God, she claims the title of sacred lover.  If the young priestess can gather enough humans and sacrifice them, she will be rewarded by her God and be elevated to the rank of a High Priestess."

selectmonster "Ba'alite Spearman"  # also "Ba'alite Archer", "Ba'alite Heavy Infantry"
descr "The cult of Ba'al is violent and warlike.  Many of the cultists are trained as soldiers of the holy war.  They are driven by a religious fervor and are led to believe that they will be rewarded in this life or the next.  By looking at their companions they will soon figure out that the reward will come in the next life, because so far none of the low ranking soldiers seem to have any gold to spare."

selectmonster "Ba'alite Zealot"
descr "The most fanatic of the Ba'alite cultists are known as Zealots.  They serve at the temples and follow their priestesses in war.  They would gladly give their life for the reward of a blissful afterlife."

selectmonster "Gibbor"
descr "The Gibborim are lesser descendants of the primeval giants that walked the earth when Ba'al was incarnate.  They are men of great stature and prowess.  The priestesses of Ba'al perform blood feasts in honor of their dark God to attract Gibborim to their cause."

selectmonster "Anakite"  # also "Anakite Captain"
descr "The Anakim are descendants of the primeval giants that walked the earth when Ba'al was incarnate.  They are deathly pale six-fingered giants with great horns and tremendous strength and prowess.  The priestesses of Ba'al perform blood feasts in the honor of their dark God to attract Anakim to their cause."

selectmonster "Adon"
descr "The Adon is an Anakite lord of the Time of Giants.  Bestowed with temporal and religious power, the Adon was king, judge, priest and prophet to his brethren.  Now he has been called by the servants of Ba'al to once more feast upon the flesh of men.  The Adonim are giants with pale complexion, six-fingered hands and long horns."

selectmonster "Zamzummite"
descr "The Zamzummite, or the Murmurer, is an Anakite sorcerer and shepherd of the dead.  During the Time of Giants they presided at the cultic funerary festivals and the banquets for the dead Rephaite kings.  Now they are called by the servants of Ba'al to prepare the world for the second coming of the dark God."

selectmonster "Rephaite"
descr "The Rephaites are primordial giants that walked the earth at the time when Ba'al was incarnate.  They are huge of stature and deathly pale.  Horns grow from their foreheads and their hands have six fingers.  For millennia the Rephaim have been forgotten, but now the priestesses of Ba'al have called them back to serve their dark master and let them once more feast upon the flesh of men in horrible banquets in honor of the dead."

selectmonster "Melqart"
descr "The Melqarts were the kings and rulers of the Twin Cities in the Time of Giants, when Ba'al was incarnate.  As descendants of Azazel, the First of the Watchers, they mastered the secrets of war, weapons and cosmetics and taught their skills to humans.  However, the Melqarts had gruesome appetites and feasted on the flesh of men.  Entire cities were actually destroyed in horrible blood feasts at the whim of a Melqart.  Now they are once more called to serve their dark God and his priestesses, attracted with the lure of hideous banquets overflowing with the flesh of sacrificial victims fresh from the bloodstained altars."

selectmonster "Ditanu"
descr "The Malikum, deified kings of the Underworld, surround themselves with dead Rephaite heroes.  These heroes are known as the Ditanim, the assembly of Ditan.  When a Malik joins a banquet for the dead, he will bring with him his Ditanu heroes.  The priestesses of Ba'al can summon the Ditanim and coerce them to serve the living instead of their dead kings.  Ditanim are huge, ethereal apparitions armed with weaponry enchanted at the dawn of time.  They are formidable warriors endowed with magical powers."

selectmonster "Malik"
descr "The Melqarts, blood-thirsty Rephaite kings of ancient times, were once perceived as the sons of gods.  Now their memories have taken that place and the dead kings have become gods in the truest sense.  These deified dead are important in the cult of Ba'al.  The Malikum have made themselves kings of the Underworld, as they once were kings in the land of the living.  From their ghastly courts the Malikum answer the call of the priestesses of Ba'al to receive life undying in the living world in exchange for the lives of many men at a banquet for the dead.  Accompanied by their Ditanim, they return to lead the Rephaim and other servants of Ba'al as incarnate gods."

selectmonster "Nephil"
descr "In a primeval era of antiquity the god Ba'al incarnated for the first time and made the world taste fear and destruction.  Even Angels succumbed under the sway of his will and sinned.  They fell to lust and took wives among men.  Their offspring became the Nephilim, giants of godlike power.  These Fallen Ones were cast down and imprisoned in the Infernal realms for their sins, but the Nephilim were partly of this world and could not be banished by the Celestial Powers.  The Nephilim made themselves kings, and they fathered sons who became known as the Rephaim.  The Nephilim had unnatural appetites and devoured all that their servants could produce.  When food became scarce, they consumed beasts, men and finally their own offspring.  When Ba'al left this world, the Nephilim found that they had no comparison under the Heaven above and they lost their purpose and the will to rule.  Leaving their sons to rule, they left the land to find purpose and meaning to their existence.  Now the priestesses of Ba'al have called them back with blood and a purpose."

selectmonster "Watcher"
descr "In a primeval era of antiquity the god Ba'al incarnated for the first time and made the world taste fear and destruction.  Even Angels succumbed under the sway of his will and sinned.  Azazel was the leader of the Watchers and the first one to be seduced by the will of Ba'al.  He convinced his brethren to join him and they swore a pact that they would all commit to sin.  The Watchers took wives among men and begat the Nephilim, giants of almost godlike power.  When the Celestial Powers lashed out in fury, the Watchers were banished to the Infernal realms where they still linger, fettered by bonds of iron tempered in the blood and tears of those slain by their gifts of civilization."

selectmonster "Lammashta"
descr "Lammashtas, the Handmaidens of Death, are angelic beings who succumbed to the will of Ba'al along with the Watchers in ancient times.  They now serve his Malikum as messengers and executioners.  Lammashtas appear as horrible, winged females drenched in blood.  Their angelic nature makes them totally impervious to nonmagical weapons and they wield magical swords that reanimate those they kill."

selectmonster "Sirrush"
descr "The Sirrush is a wingless dragon of the desert.  It was once a guardian being, but it was led astray with other beings when Ba'al incarnated.  Now it follows the priestesses of Ba'al and wreaks havoc and spreads malice in return for human flesh.  The Sirrush has a scaled body, the paws of a lion, the hindlegs of an eagle and a serpent tail. Some claim it is the most ancient of all dragon-kin."

selectmonster "Desert Sun"
descr "The Desert Suns were lesser suns placed on the skies by Ba'al when he incarnated.  Now the priestesses of Ba'al have mastered the means to reproduce the miracle of Ba'al and create a Second Sun.  The Desert Sun is a physical manifestation of the Second Sun and it is immortal as long as the Second Sun burns in the sky.  It appears as a burning solar disc with the wings of a great eagle and the head of a wise king."

selectmonster "Scorpion Man"
descr "In the mountain range of Mashu lies a pass beyond which one can find the path to immortality.  This pass is guarded by giant Scorpion Men, beings of awesome terror set there to prevent mankind from learning the secrets of the Rephaim.  They are armed with deadly bows and swords.  The mere gaze of a Scorpion Man makes mountains tremble in fear."

selectmonster "Large Spider Familiar"
descr "While most Large Spiders serve their own agenda, there are some that remember the blessings given to them by Ba'al.  Their loyalty is rewarded and their usual cunning is heightened to superhuman levels.  The priestesses of Ba'al use these spiders as company, friends and possibly lovers."

selectmonster "Giant Scorpion"
descr "A ridiculously large scorpion.  Apparently it is nowhere near as clever as the overgrown spiders also found in the service of the Ba'alite priestesses."

selectmonster "Scorpion Beast"
descr "Ba'al has blessed the wicked and poisonous creatures that crawl on the face of the earth.  Huge scorpions and spiders alike serve the dark God with cunning and malice.  With human sacrifice to their master, the monsters come crawling out of caves and deserts, ready to serve the priestesses of Ba'al."

selectmonster "Mazzik"
descr "The Mazzikim are imp servants of the god Ba'al.  They are sometimes encountered in desert environments where they terrorize unwary travelers, but more often they are found in the service of the priestesses of Ba'al.  Mazzikim seem to be mischievous rather than malign and their presence often heralds the coming of more powerful demons."

selectmonster "Lilot"
descr "The Lilin are reputedly the offspring of Lilith, a demoness of primeval times and the Mother of Demons.  Lilin appear as winged women with the lower part of a hind.  Their appearance is strangely alluring and they seduce and abduct men of weak morals.  Why these demons serve the god Ba'al is not known, but it is possible that Lilith was once taken by the God as his bride.  Like many of the Ba'alite demons, they appear to be almost friendly to mankind, but let not this fool you.  They serve only Ba'al, or possibly their demon mother."

selectmonster "Se'ir"
descr "The Se'irim are goat-demons of the desert begotten by Azazel, Bringer and Taker of Civilization.  After breaking his celestial vows, the angel sided with Ba'al and sinned against man and beast.  Now his progeny roam the deserts of Elysium.  The priestesses of Ba'al are occasionally rewarded with Se'irim servants after having sacrificed blood in the desert."

selectmonster "Shed"
descr "The Shedim are winged, ox-headed storm demons and servants of Ba'al.  They roam the wastelands of Elysium and spread wanton destruction.  The priestesses of Ba'al are occasionally rewarded with Shedim servants after having sacrificed blood in the desert."

selectmonster "Manticore"
descr "The Manticore, or Man-Eater, is a primordial beast of incomparable hunger possibly spawned by Lilith, the demon goddess and consort of Ba'al.  It has the body of a scorpion-tailed lion, with the face of a man with three rows of teeth, one for each hunger, according to misinformed scholars.  In truth it only makes the beast look strange.  Sometimes Manticores lead small groups of bandits and send them to capture human victims to still their appetites."

selectmonster "Priest King"
descr "The Priest King is the highest ranking priest and ruler of Aztlan, a kingdom of undeveloped and superstitious savages.  While considered sacred to their own populace, it is clear that they only use their blasphemous religion to cow their subjects into submission and use their blood and souls to appease their Demon Gods, which are known as Teotls.  Whenever they get a chance, they will capture civilized men as slaves and herd them along with their armies of savages and brutes.  The priests of their kingdom have somehow acquired magical powers from their Demon Gods.  The Priest King is supposed to be blessed by the Warrior God of the Sun and he is followed by sacred Sun Warriors and Jaguar Warriors, which according to Monforte, are fed with human flesh."

selectmonster "Tribal King"
descr "The Tribal Kings are lesser rulers of the savages of Aztlan.  Like their priestly rulers, they enjoy capturing civilized men into slavery.  Recent reports confirm that they enslave and torment their own populace as readily as they do foreigners.  Elysium will be a better place when the savages are all killed."

selectmonster "Slave"
descr "The vile practices of the Priest Kings do not end with cannibalism.  Their subservient tribal kings capture the faithful and force them into slavery and humiliation.  There are numerous reports of enslaved villagers conscripted against their will into the armies of the Priest Kings, forced to fight against their former brothers."

selectmonster "Sun Temple Attendant"
descr "The tribal kings share their power with blasphemous priests of the six Demon Gods of Aztlan.  There are six orders of priests that serve the Priest King and they all undoubtedly practice cannibalism and human sacrifice.  The priests of the Sun form the highest order and the current Priest King is always a Sun Priest."

selectmonster "Blood Temple Attendant"  # also "Death Temple Attendant", "Rain Temple Attendant", "Moon Temple Attendant", "Sky Temple Attendant"
descr "The tribal kings share their power with blasphemous priests of the six Demon Gods of Aztlan.  There are six orders of priests that serve the Priest King and they all undoubtedly practice cannibalism and human sacrifice."

selectmonster "Tribal Warrior"
descr "Most of the Aztlan armies are made up of savage brutes without any understanding of proper warfare and advanced tactics.  They only use crude weapons and fight as naked as God created them.  Monforte has given plenty of indisputable evidence of their cannibalistic practices, although some scholars claim that human flesh would only be available to the sacred Jaguar Warriors."

selectmonster "Jungle Warrior"
descr "Jungle Warriors are Aztlan warriors given crude suits of armor covered in green bird feathers that give them some camouflage when moving in forests.  Wise men should avoid the southern forests or travel with the armies of righteous rulers for protection."

selectmonster "Feathered Warrior"
descr "Some prominent savages are given feathered head plumes and more sophisticated arms.  It is almost certain that they adopted this practice after having witnessed the crested helmets of the Temple Guard, as no evidence of early feathered headdresses has been acquired to this day."

selectmonster "Jaguar Warrior"
descr "The elites of the savages are called Jaguar Warriors.  They are considered sacred and demonstrate remarkable skill for such a backwards nation.  It is even possible that a large group of the brutes could stand up against the Temple Guard.  They are often nobleborn, and partake in the cannibalistic feasts and ceremonies reported by several trustworthy brothers."

selectmonster "Sun Warrior"
descr "The Sun Warriors are the elites of the elites.  Blessed by their Sun God, they fight with savage ferocity.  However, they are barely more skilled than the average Temple Guard and would not stand a chance against a Templar of the Faith."

selectmonster "Moon Warrior"
descr "The Moon Warriors are the fourth of the sacred warrior societies at the Priest King's disposal.  They are supposed to be blessed by the Moon and are armed with heavy club swords made of wood and sharp obsidian shards.  They could probably be a threat to lightly armed soldiers and other tribal brutes.  Reports of Moon Warriors gifted with unholy powers are most likely exaggerations by incompetent commanders."

selectmonster "Eagle Warrior"
descr "The Eagle Warriors are proof that the Demonic Gods act on behalf of the savages, although some respected scholars claim that extraordinary herbs would produce the exact same effects.  Dressed in loin-cloths and wing-contraptions blessed with witch-flight, they soar above the battlefield like flies from hell.  But discipline does not come easily to the savages and most Eagle Warriors will be cut down by the faithful after the initial shock."

selectmonster "Jaguar"
descr "The Jaguar is a jungle cat of such great ferocity that some savages regard it as a servant of the God of War.  It is wicked and sly and not at all righteous like the Lion that only hunts to feed its cubs."

selectmonster "Ozelotl"
descr "The Ozelotl is a jaguar fiend sent by the Teotl Demon Gods.  Giuseppe claims that they are of infernal nature and can be banished by the righteous, but if so, they should have been encountered at the battle of Crec, where the Infernal Lords emerged from the Pit."

selectmonster "Balam"
descr "The Balam is a myth perpetuated by the Priest Kings to cow their subjects.  To believe that there are Jaguars the size of Elephants in the jungles is plain idiocy.  It is a typical example of how the superstitious mind can be exploited by those in power."

selectmonster "Great Macaw"
descr "The Great Macaw is a demon bird of gigantic proportions, gifted with the blasphemous powers of the Teotl gods of Aztlan.  The beast has been sighted soaring high above the camps and cities of the Priest Kings, most likely looking for the sick and wounded to feed upon.  The demon bird has very good vision and numerous faithful scouts have lost their lives when moving too close to Aztlan encampments."

selectmonster "Couatl"
descr "The Couatl is the Feathered Serpent of Aztlan myth.  Supposed to be a benevolent and sacred being of the skies come to aid humanity, it is more likely that it is a serpentine fiend of Inferno sent to fool the savages into unspeakable practices of cannibalism and sins even worse.  According to legend, it is a great winged serpent with the power to command the storms and the weather."

selectmonster "Beast Bat"
descr "The Beast Bat is a fiendish bat of unnatural size sent by the Teotl Demon Gods.  Its presence has mostly been reported near the camps of Moon Temple Attendants, but it is likely that more of the blasphemous priests know how to summon these fiends.  The Beast Bats have an uncanny ability to find both scouts and magically concealed travelers."

selectmonster "Civateteo"
descr "Caravans travelling through Aztlan territories have reported that they have been attacked by skeletal women in bridal dress when camping at certain crossroads.  These white women cause madness and disease and even wake the dead to attack the living.  The Aztlani savages consider the spectres honored women, the spirits of those who have died in the battle of childbirth.  In truth the apparitions are the souls of remarkably heinous sinners, banned from a peaceful afterlife in the Blessed Lands.  The reverence given them by the savage priests is yet another display of the abominable order of their backward kingdom."

selectmonster "Onaqui"
descr "The Onaqui is a jungle demon only reported in obscure myths.  Since the savages of Aztlan are mostly illiterate, it comes as no surprise that they tell ever more fanciful stories about the unknown perils of the dark woods.  The Onaqui is possibly an anointed Ozelotl, but according to the savages, its powers are vastly superior to those of the Jaguar Fiends.  It supposedly emerges at night to feed on the hearts of men.  In the unlikely event that a real Onaqui would be encountered, it should be banishable by any righteous priest."

selectmonster "Bolon-Ti-Ku"
descr "The Bolon-Ti-Ku are demons of the Underworld called by the wicked priests of Aztlan.  Their origin is disputed and while most scholars agree that the Bolon-Ti-Ku probably are of Infernal nature like the other servants of the Teotl Demon Gods, there are some sages who make convincing arguments in favor of placing them under the rule of Orcus, the Prince of Death.  This could mean that the Priest Kings and their subservient priests are not limited to conjuring Infernal forces, but might be able to summon the Stygian dead as well.  We have not yet captured a Goetic Master capable of summoning a Bolon-Ti-Ku, so the question remains unsolved."

selectmonster "Tzitzimitl"
descr "The Tzitzimitl is a demon of the Stellar Sphere.  Since this is the origin of Angels, most scholars agree that the Tzitzimitl were once divine beings, punished for their sins and banished to some lower plane of existence.  In their depraved state they readily accepted the bloody sacrifices and attention of the Priest Kings and fell into further wickedness.  Now they have fully succumbed under the sway of evil and are without redemption.  The Star Demons are forever cursed with an appearance to match their sins, with huge blue-skinned bodies, scorpion tails, claws for hands and feathered arms.  The only thing pure about them are the star crowns placed on their foreheads to forever remind them of what they have lost."

selectmonster "Plumed Serpent"
descr "The Plumed Serpent is as large as an Elephant and as wicked as a Wolf.  It has a crest of feathers on its head and these feathers are used to make the crested helmets of high ranking priests.  The Plumed Serpent is revered by the savages of Aztlan as messengers of the Bloody Mother, and there are numerous reports of the beasts being used by the Priest Kings in warfare.  They are fed slaves and oxen, but the current Priest King has fed several of our missionaries to these horrible monsters to display his displeasure with the righteousness of our cause."

selectmonster "Tlahuelpuchi"
descr "The Tlahuelpuchi is a blood-sucking demon-witch that primarily attacks infants.  Like all Witches, the Tlahuelpuchi come to their power in puberty, and there is still no known means to discern their true nature before that.  It is even possible that they, and other Witches, are corrupted at puberty, and are not inherently depraved.  The Tlahuelpuchi are able to change their shape and therefore difficult to capture, but some have been caught sneaking about in our army camps.  Being Witches, they respond well to dunking in water and trial by fire."

selectmonster "Teotl of War"
descr "The Teotl of War is the main God of the Priest Kings' pantheon.  He is the son of the Bloody Mother and was born aware and fully armed, after she was impregnated with a ball of feathers.  He slew his siblings and made himself ruler of the world, or so the legend says.  Before the unexplained disappearance of Guillaume's Templar army there were rumors that the Priest King had been devoured and his people were led by an incarnation of the Teotl of War.  If the demonic Teotl gods are indeed able to manifest their powers and appear in Elysium when called by human sacrifice, we have reason to call a full scale Crusade against the savages of the southern realms."

selectmonster "Priest of the Bloody Mother"  # also "Priest of the Dead", "Rain Priest", "Moon Priest", "Sky Priest"
descr "The tribal kings share their power with blasphemous priests of the six Demon Gods of Aztlan.  There are six orders of priests that serve the Priest King and they all undoubtedly practice cannibalism and human sacrifice.  A priest able to gather and sacrifice enough slaves will be blessed by his patron god and will rise in power and influence among the savages.  The priests of the savages often travels with the armies of the Priest King to bless the soldiers and attack the enemy with spells granted by their patron god."

selectmonster "High Priest of the Sun"  # also "High Priest of the Bloody Mother", "High Priest of the Sky", "High Priest of the Rain", "High Priest of the Night", "High Priest of the Dead"
descr "An Aztlan priest able to outperform his fellow priests in atrocities is rewarded by his peers as well as by his blasphemous Demon God and will receive status as a high priest, possibly replacing even the Priest King in temporal power.  The High Priest is endowed with great powers and can bless his subjects or cause devastation among enemies, but the true blessing of the patron god seems to be a promise of death.  The High Priest is supposed to prepare the kingdom for the coming of his Patron God, an event that will inevitably cost the priest his own life, as well as the death of thousands of innocents."

selectmonster "Nahualli"
descr "The Nahualli is a hedge wizard of the savage tribes of the Priest King.  They are even less educated than the regular hedge wizard, but might have gathered powers from physical deprivation or exposure to toad toxins.  Even the savages themselves seem to disrespect the Nahualli."

selectmonster "Old Nahualli"
descr "In the unlikely event that a Nahualli survives the toxins and bodily treatments of his trade, he might gather powers that can actually make a difference.  Old beyond his age, but gifted with wild magic and the ability to send curses and plagues upon the righteous, the Old Nahualli is best avoided."

selectmonster "Teotl of Rain"
descr "The Teotl of Rain is a God of the Priest Kings' pantheon.  He is the ruler of a paradise from which comes rain, fortune and fertility.  So far the only blessings we have seen him deliver are torrential rains and overly damp forests.  The savages clearly do not understand the concept of a benign God, and their religion is focused on placating demonic entities out of fear rather than humble devotion.  The stone idols representing the Teotl of Rain have a resemblance to toads, and his priests are often accompanied by strange Toad Warriors.  Increasing numbers of toads in the temple gardens have worried the Pontiff, who has placed a bounty of one silver piece for every toad or frog leg delivered to his staff.  Evil rumors claim that the gathering of frogs has culinary rather than religious reasons."

selectmonster "Ether Warrior"
descr "Ether Warriors are members of a race of large, humanoid beings that were banished from this world in ancient times.  Their wars drained the world of Arcana and they were forced to enter other realms of existence in order to continue their clan wars.  The lesser races and their gods sealed the astral gates behind the Ether Warriors to ensure the safety of the world.  Ether Warriors are powerful beings and can live for centuries unless slain in battle.  All members of the race are ethereal and very difficult to harm with non-magical weapons."

selectmonster "Ether Lord"
descr "An Ether Lord is an ancient mage and clan leader of the Ether Warriors.  It was the Ether Lords who had drained the world of Arcana and led their clans into their otherworldly realm to continue their internecine wars.  Ether Lords are ethereal and very difficult to harm with non-magical weapons."

selectmonster "Elder Thing"
descr "Elder Things are strange beings from a distant past.  They once ruled all that is Elysium and explored the world underneath, Agartha.  When they opened gates into the void and explored the madness beyond time they unleashed the horrors of the void and succumbed to insanity.  For millennia the Elder Things and their lore have been absent.  Now Elder Things are summoned back from the void by by mad cultists searching for hidden knowledge."

selectmonster "Strange Thing"
descr "Strange Things are beings from a distant past.  They probably emerged from the void during a time when Elysium was thinner and less stable.  They disappeared from Elysium millennia ago and are only known through strange inscriptions on ancient temple walls and the mutterings of fools and fishermen."

selectmonster "Yithian"  # also "Yithian Sage"
descr "Yithians are strange beings from a distant past.  They once emerged to wage war on the Elder Things, but have since retracted to the comfort of the void.  Yithians were powerful mages of the astral spheres and the mind.  According to old scriptures and temple hieroglyphs they used their powers of precognition to foresee their own fall.  By returning to the Void they presumably avoided extinction.  However there are reports of strange cone-shaped beings living in the deeper reaches of the earth."

selectmonster "Formless Spawn"
descr "Sometimes the madness and hunger of the void manifests and takes physical form.  The Formless Spawn is a shapeless hunger that devours anything alive and consumes bodies and souls alike.  The Spawn is not of this world and difficult to harm with the weapons and elements of Elysium."

selectmonster "Star Oak"
descr "During clear nights you can sometimes imagine that the stars move on their own accord like leaves in the wind.  It might be a dream, or it might be that you perceive what mad men have called the Star Oak.  Star Oaks are strange stellar beings reminiscent of the anemones of the seas.  They appear as star clusters forming a trunk with tentacles.  When they get their prey close their tentacles rip the body apart and a stellar maw opens in their trunk and consumes the soul before it can escape to the other world."

selectmonster "Void Hound"
descr "'Lean and athirst', Void Hounds are pale gaunt hounds with bluish tongues that feed on suffering and fear.  They evolved in a time that flows orthogonally to our time and therefore manifest through angles and corners.  Hunting those who have been touched by the Beyond, the Hounds manifest in corners, where time is susceptible to change.  The Hounds appear to teleport, but this is only due to time flowing in another direction.  It is said that gibbering lunatics speak of a city without corners somewhere deep in the void where the hounds are bred for a Scourge to come."

selectmonster "Brass Claw Horror"  # also "Dream Horror", "Float Cat Horror", "Gore Tide Horror", "Horror Mantis", "Horror Olm", "Mind Slime Horror", "Moon Horror", "Spine Membrane Horror", "Soultorn"
descr "Horrors are astral beings that feed on the emotions of suffering, lamentation and fear.  They have strangely distorted perceptions and their motives cannot be comprehended by sane people.  Horrors are often attracted to magic and special care should be taken when performing rituals close to the Void where the Horrors thrive."

selectmonster "Hunter of Gods"
descr "The Hunter of Gods is a Doom Horror, an astral being that feeds on the emotions of suffering, lamentation and fear.  The Hunter of Gods primarily targets Gods, because they provide much more more emotional sustenance than mere mortals.  The Hunter of Gods has emerged several times in history and slain the gods and exalted spirits of the time."

selectmonster "Maker of Ruins"
descr "The Maker of Ruins is a Doom Horror, an astral being that feeds on the emotions of suffering, lamentation and fear.  The Maker of Ruins has emerged in the world several times in history and wreaked havoc, laying waste to entire continents and leaving only the shattered remains of broken cities in its wake."

selectmonster "Slave to Unreason"
descr "The Slave to Unreason is a Doom Horror, an astral being that feeds on the emotions of suffering, lamentation and fear.  The Slave to Unreason has emerged in the world several times in history and brought insanity and madness to entire kingdoms."

selectmonster "High Cultist"
descr "According to recent rumors, a small coastal cult seems to have grown rapidly in the past few years.  Originally it was set up by a local mystic and Hydromancer, most likely to satisfy the founder's desire for obedient followers and carnal lust.  It is most likely a rather harmless sect and despite the current High Cultist's ravings about ancient gods, nothing more than just another fish cult."

selectmonster "Cultist of the Deep"
descr "The strength of a cult almost always depends on having a good number of followers or cultists prepared to perform the necessary sacrifices to appease their gods or to do some dark deed or another.  The exception being of course the Cult of Ahala the Mad, which seems to thrive with just one unwilling follower at time.  And may I never meet that one.  The Cultist of the Deep seems to be obsessed with blood sacrifices and the number three and they have an unnatural attraction to aquatic beings.  It is not advisable to buy romantic or erotic literature from cities that are permeated with these cultists, as I have been told that they can be highly unnerving.  Visits to their towns are not recommended either.  Though usually situated at scenic coastal locations, the unsuspecting traveler will often find him or herself strapped to an altar surrounded by Cultists in fish masks wielding obsidian daggers."

selectmonster "Hybrid Cultist"
descr "Rumors from surviving travelers to remote coastal towns tell that there are some fish cultists who seem to be the result of crossbreeding between human women and some kind of fish creatures.  They receive traits from their aquatic fathers such as gills, scales or just being grey and slimy.  Though they have some innate magical abilities, they are often imbeciles and should not be asked for advice, because the answer will either involve more sacrifices or eating unhealthy amounts of shrimps.  Despite their lack of wits, the result of this planned breeding are considered to have high status and are readily taken into the fold of the cult.  If you encounter anyone remotely fishy in a coastal town, it is better to be safe than sorry.  There have been some problems for the workers at the manufactury where Mergus pickled cod tongues are produced."

selectmonster "Star Child"
descr "Sometimes some of the Hybrid Cultists seem to have been born with a bit more wits, even though they do not seem to be fully in this world.  Such cultists are highly regarded, though their plots are often too otherworldly to make them suitable for the role of High Cultist.  They seem to retain some memories of the Deep and can even call upon their marine ancestry by pouring blood and corpses into certain select bays on the coast."

selectmonster "Insane Fisherman"
descr "If nothing else, the odor should be enough to keep any civilized person from visiting the smaller fishing village along the coast.  However, where the Cult of the Deep has taken hold, the fishermen behave in an increasingly erratic manner and have an exaggerated fondness for the sea.  In the cult villages interbreeding with sea creatures seems to be far more rampant than in other coastal villages, producing offspring with an almost fishlike appearance and mind that is a few sardines short of a full tin."

selectmonster "Hybrid Fisherman"
descr "In coastal villages controlled by the Cult of the Deep, it has been noted that a growing number of the inhabitants seem to become more and more fishlike as they grow old.  As they become more aquatic, their wits seem to diminish.  If they manage to reach old age they are rumored to return to the sea, but rumors always abound when rural villagers get rid of their old relatives."

selectmonster "Hybrid Spearman"
descr "Many of the half man, half fish creatures are not really fit to be fishermen, because a tentacled arm really does not work well at hauling nets.  A spear on the other hand only requires one hand and not too much thinking since all that is needed is jabbing at things with the pointy end.  The spearmen are usually at the end of their transformation and it would be difficult if not dangerous to try to dress them in armor, and if given a shield, they seem to mainly sit in it, perhaps in memory of a boat."

selectmonster "Hybrid Soldier"
descr "The hybrids who retain a bit more of their senses are often given both shield and light armor and somehow make up the basic unit in the armies of the Cult of the Deep.  Though not as well trained as most soldiers, their ability to walk under water makes them a dangerous threat and allows them to assault coastal settlements from the sea, walking up from the depths of the harbor."

selectmonster "Angler Spawn"
descr "Though some of our scholars find it an interesting experiment in theory, the creation of new creatures through breeding rather than pure magic is considered cheating against the laws of magic according to Aegus in his Encyclopediae of Magic Theory.  By making an extract of male Angler fish and soaking female deep ones in it, one can get male angler fish to attach themselves to a Shambler, giving them the characteristic lantern of the angler fish.  From there it takes a minor magical manipulation to actually get the angler male to be completely absorbed by the Deep One and thus impregnating her."

selectmonster "Angler of the Depths"
descr "Though experiments with the hybridization of Deep Ones and angler fish has been banned all through the realm, some hideous samples of what must be failed experiments sometimes wash up on the seashore.  Dissection of the remains has revealed it to be the the result of an abhorrent coupling between a male angler fish and a female Shambler produces a far more powerful creature than either of its parents.  In theory such a creature would have the predator mind and lantern of its father and the sturdy body of a Shambler of its mother.  Let us all hope that those horrendous underwater experiments do not bear fruit."

selectmonster "Pillar of the Depths"
descr "Though records from the depths of the oceans are generally  untrustworthy and most often the tales of drunken sailors, recent attacks on coastal settlements seem to lend some credence to some of these tales.  According to a very fanciful and loosetongued sailor - who claimed he got his knowledge from a Mermaid he seduced ‚Äì the temples of the depths are defended by heavily armored Shamblers who would happily kill and devour any intruder.  The sailor in question claims that he managed to steal a treasure from the temples by dressing up in the carapace of a Shambler and pretending to be a temple guard."

selectmonster "Basalt Queen"
descr "At times fragmented pieces of information float ashore, giving us an insight into the kingdoms under water.  Crude imprints on sea shells and the occasional ravings of people who claim to have been abducted to the deep sea all give a picture of a huge Angler Spawn ruling deepest ocean.  Between the frothing and the usual ravings about some ‚Äú...stur‚Äù, the abductees who have been washed ashore mutter something about the queen sacrificing their minds to an Old One.  Disregarding such nonsense, researchers have managed to come to the conclusion that this elderly Angler Spawn must have absorbed many males, accumulating whatever esoteric power they may contain."

selectmonster "Basalt King"
descr "If for some reason an Angler of the Depths fails to mate in his first season, he will grow in power and gain both wizardly and priestly powers.  Though he is co-ruler of the aquatic kingdom, his rule is limited, because within a year of coming to power he will feel the urge to mate with the Basalt Queen."

selectmonster "Deep One"
descr "One of the major drawbacks of living by the sea is the constant risk of being raided by Deep Ones, aquatic creatures with an interest in human flesh ‚Äì both for gastronomic and carnal reasons.  Though they can be placated by sacrifices, they are too strange to rule in ordinary ways.  In attempts to preemptively eradicate their settlements, strange carvings of ancient gods have been found on cave walls and in coral reefs.  Some of their features seem to indicate that they are a form of slimy reptile,  but there is still an ongoing debate at the College as to how to classify them.  Though their head and extremities are in many ways similar to frogs and toads, the offspring that might be produced by breeding with humans, such as can be found in cultist infested villages, often sport many features from various sea creatures."

selectmonster "Deep One Warrior"
descr "For some reason someone has managed to dress Deep Ones in simple tunics and give them spears.  Such a move can hardly result in anything good.  It also suggests that someone is controlling them, which is also an indication of something bad happening.  Luckily, they most often appear in villages filled with cultists, and such villages should be avoided in any case."

selectmonster "Shambler"
descr "In her 'Bestiarium Oceanica', Ruga lists the many creatures living in the ocean, classified through studies of captured specimens, remains that have washed ashore and the occasional conversations with deep sea creatures.  Among the many creatures that plague the shores of the realm, the Shamblers stand out.  Their thick carapace-like skin and great strength turns them into a great menace for many villages by the sea.  Luckily they do not appear to be too bright and have strange ways of moving sideways when attacking, which is why it is quite possible to outsmart what appears to be a superior force.  It has been argued that the Shambler shares some traits with crabs, lobsters and other shellfish.  Though their carapace is far softer, experiments with boiling Shamblers have revealed that they do indeed turn somewhat red when cooked."

selectmonster "War Shambler"
descr "Though slow and moving predictably sideways, a squad of War Shamblers kan be a terrible foe, as they are stronger and more durable than your regular grunt.  People who have fought them have also told me that they even seem to be able to follow orders to some degree.  Though it is still possible to outwit and outmaneuver them, they are a bit more capable than their ordinary brethren."

selectmonster "Shambler Prince"
descr "Although the Shamblers seem too primitive to have any structured society, some reports of a seasoned warrior showing more wits than the others and clad in armor made of corals surface from time to time.  Obviously, any kind of ruler over the Shamblers must be the result of an external involvement."

selectmonster "Starspawn"
descr "Astronomers occasionally report how large stones from the stars descend upon us, causing harm, destruction and ill omens.  These celestial purgings are highly sought after, however, because they are rumored to be a strong magical conduit.  In rare cases these stones appear to have been hollowed out, containing the remains of a strange creature that seems to have died upon impact.  The tentacled creature looks like nothing else in the realm, but ancient texts talk about envoys from the stars serving a mad god from the Void.  However, this mode of traveling seem to indicate that they have been exiled rather than summoned.  Though none have been encountered alive, it has been speculated that should a starstone descend into the sea, the impact would be less grave, allowing for the odd creature to survive.  This would also explain the strange altars with crude images of tentacled humanoids found in the caves of the Deep Ones."

selectmonster "Elder Starspawn"
descr "For centuries the realms under water seem to have been under the influence of servants of the Old Gods, steering the Shamblers and Deep Ones down an ever darker path.  Though often content with staying in the depths of the oceans, they seem to have recently turned their attention on land in order to increase their potential sacrifices.  Though exiled, they still seem to serve and worship the mad writhing mass of the Void.  By offering the dead gods a large enough sacrifice, they will gain more power, giving them the ability to call forth the horrible servants from their gods' demented dreams and set them loose to hunt the inhabitants of our realm. "

selectmonster "Void Lord"
descr "Though the Basalt Queens seem to think of themselves as the keepers and protectors of the Old Gods, the rituals to summon them do not always produce the desired result.  On rare occasions the piles of sacrifices offered will arouse the interest of the mindless temple guardians of the Void - the Void Lord.  Terrible to behold and enraged to have been called forth from the Void, they will march out seeking new victims to sustain their unspeakable hunger.  Looking like nothing else in the realm, they can only be the creation of a mad god's twisted imagination. "

selectmonster "Angler Queen"
descr "It is rumored that in the darkest depths of the ocean there sleeps an Angler Spawn that has absorbed hundreds of anglers.  Being the first to ever come in contact with the Old Ones, her mind is quite twisted, and she seems to share the madness of the stars.  While she is lulled to sleep by scores of smaller creatures, at times the clamor of a powerful oceanic creature may wake her from a sleep that should not be disturbed."

selectmonster "Shade Beast"
descr "The Shade Beast is a hideous apparition, summoned from its native realm and bound by Necromancy.  Its mindless stare puts fear into the heart of men and its fangs are imbued with Stygian power.  Anyone killed by a Shade Beast is reanimated by the Stygian energies released when the spirit is ripped from its dying body.  Shade Beasts roam the Shade Lands of the Underworld, much in the same way as Deer roam the forests and plains of Elysium.  Well-traveled Necromancers can attest to their cunning and sudden attacks on newly conquered Stygian settlements.  While not universally accepted, there is a theory that the Shade Beasts are in fact the spirits of dead wildlife."

selectmonster "Mound King"
descr "When kings and other important persons are buried, their corpses usually become restless after a while and then they rise as Mound Kings.  Mound Kings retain their sense of importance from when they were alive and they soon take command of other undead and start recreating a kingdom to rule."

selectmonster "Longdead"
descr "The Longdead are so called because their bones have lain long enough in the ground that worms and other corpse-feeders have gnawed away most of the flesh.  While most longdead are the result of necromantic practices, there are numerous reports of skeletal remains walking about without necromantic leadership.  While tempting, most of us have discarded the idea that the bones of mortals carry memories, and independent longdead arise when the memories of the bones have been weakened enough to forget that they are dead, but remember how to walk.  This Dementia Theory is at least more attractive than the Bored Bones Theory that claims that everything is inhabited by a spirit, a spirit that can become bored with lying around immobile and therefore animates the vessel it inhabits, in this case a set of unfleshed bones."

selectmonster "Longdead Animal"  # also "Longdead Beast"
descr "Humans are not the only race that have problems with their bones starting to wander after having been dead for a long time.  The beasts have the same problem, but to a somewhat lesser extent.  It is believed that boars enjoy eating skeletal remains and thus leaves little left to become bored and walk again.  Many necromancers find it useful to reanimate beasts as they are usually stronger than humans and when dead they are equally stupid.  Reanimating the bones requires taxing incantations and much manual work and is probably best left to the eager apprentice."

selectmonster "Longdead Hastatus"
descr "The Longdead are so called because their bones have lain long enough in the ground that worms and other corpse-feeders have gnawed away most of the flesh.  The taxing incantations and manual work required to exhume and reanimate the Longdead are perhaps best left to the eager apprentice.  The Longdead Hastatus is the reanimated remains of a legionnaire from some ancient and long forgotten empire."

selectmonster "Longdead Principe"
descr "The Longdead are so called because their bones have lain long enough in the ground that worms and other corpse-feeders have gnawed away most of the flesh.  The taxing incantations and manual work required to exhume and reanimate the Longdead are perhaps best left to the eager apprentice.  The Longdead Principe is the reanimated remains of a legionnaire from some ancient and long forgotten empire."

selectmonster "Longdead Triarius"
descr "The Longdead are so called because their bones have lain long enough in the ground that worms and other corpse-feeders have gnawed away most of the flesh.  The taxing incantations and manual work required to exhume and reanimate the Longdead are perhaps best left to the eager apprentice.  The Longdead Triarius is the reanimated remains of a legionnaire from some ancient and long forgotten empire."

selectmonster "Longdead Velite"
descr "The Longdead are so called because their bones have lain long enough in the ground that worms and other corpse-feeders have gnawed away most of the flesh.  The taxing incantations and manual work required to exhume and reanimate the Longdead are perhaps best left to the eager apprentice.  The Longdead Velite is the reanimated remains of a legionnaire from some ancient and long forgotten empire."

selectmonster "Soulless"
descr "Unburied dead can be put to use by those who know the Dark Arts.  A fresh corpse makes a more sturdy vessel than the naked bones of the Longdead, but is still susceptible to holy energies.  While not as common as necromantically independent Longdead, there are Soulless that appear near cemeteries and haunted cities, regardless of the presence Necromancers.  The Dementia Theory suggests that independent Soulless are less common because the flesh of the newly dead is a greater repository for memories and the flesh is commonly the part of the body that experienced the process of the dying.  Thus the post-mortem dementia has less effects on a body less decomposed and spontaneous Soulless are less common than spontaneous Longdead."

selectmonster "Ghoul"
descr "Ghouls like to eat people, but the problem is that as soon as the person eaten on dies it will become a ghoul as well.  The Ghouls don't like undead meat and now there is one extra Ghoul to feed.  This means that Ghouls are cursed to be forever hungry and maybe that is why they don't live for as long as most other undeads do."

selectmonster "Wight"  # also "Wight Lord"
descr "The Wight is a preserved corpse possessed by a spirit of the nether realms.  It is not always the spirit associated with the vessel in life that so inhabits it.  Be warned that it has a will of its own, although oft well suited to service.  The Wight has great physical strength and its flesh is hardened by otherworldly energies."

selectmonster "Corpse Mage"
descr "The Corpse Mage is a deceased Necromancer who has learned the 'Twiceborn' ritual and used it to bind his spirit to the flesh of a reanimated body.  The Corpse Mage retains its Necromantic skills and insanity, but its connection to the Underworld allows it to recover a small portion of its sanity every month."

selectmonster "Wight Mage"
descr "The Wight Mage is the remains of a powerful deceased Necromancer who has performed the 'Twiceborn' ritual to bind his spirit to the flesh of his reanimated body.  The Wight Mage retains its Necromantic skills and insanity, but its connection to the Underworld allows it to recover a small portion of its sanity every month.  Most Necromancers who have cast twiceborn try to avoid death, since true immortality through lichcraft or blood rites are unavailable to the dry husk of a Wight.  Only the heart, blood and organs of a living mortal can be properly prepared for immortality."

selectmonster "Wight King"
descr "The Wight King is the remains of a deceased Necromancer of great power who has performed the 'Twiceborn' ritual to bind his spirit to the flesh of his reanimated body.  The Wight King retains its great Necromantic skills and insanity, but its connection to the Underworld allows it to recover some of its sanity every month."

selectmonster "Necromancer's Apprentice"
descr "Necromancy is generally considered one of the lesser arcane arts, but it is a good start to learn magic when young. I guess We all all had some fun with reanimating simple things during our apprenticeship years, and it was only a few years ago that we had a craze in which every child was to have their own reanimated mouse or sparrow. But childish pursuits do not fit the grown up mage so there is no wonder that the necromancer in general is an unbalanced and unstable creature. Actually the apprentices are often more useful than the real necromancers as their chores might have kept them too busy to develop a weirdness of their own."

selectmonster "Necromancer"
descr "Most grown up necromancers can be divided into three major groups. The brooders who dress in black, seem incessantly moody and prefer the company of death. Occasionally the brooders will try to revenge a forgotten old slight by raising an army of the undead and march upon the settlement where the perceived wrongdoer lives. Another common necromancer is the person who has lost a loved one and tries to revive him or her. As most will not contend with a mindless rotting version of their loved ones they often have to isolate themselves studying the undead. Of course as they most often only will end up with a rotting mindless creature anyway, they will go quite mad. The third group of necromancers is made up of people lacking friends and try to create them through a horde of undead. Who has not seen the deranged student of magic talking to en animated doll or even plain air. It is far worse seeing the disturbed necromancer talking to a host of rotting corpses."

selectmonster "Grand Necromancer"
descr "A master of the Dark Arts, adept at summoning beings from the Shade Lands and often versed in the ancient arts of mummification and reanimation.  Strength of will and some manual labor is required to achieve mastery over the undead.  The Grand Necromancer has delved deep into the shadowy secrets of Undeath and achieved such power that can be surpassed only by abandoning mortal flesh."

selectmonster "Vampire"
descr "The curse of vampirism brings inhuman strength and magical power.  If a Necromancer is unwilling to give up certain pleasures of the flesh, vampirism can be preferable to lichcraft.  Although inferior in magic, the strength of blood can be quite useful for more physically demanding tasks."

selectmonster "Vampire Count"
descr "The curse of vampirism brings inhuman strength and magical power.  If a Necromancer is unwilling to give up certain pleasures of the flesh, vampirism can be preferable to lichcraft.  Although inferior in magic, the strength of blood can be quite useful for more physically demanding tasks.^The Vampire Count is a Vampire risen high in the ranks of his kin."

selectmonster "Lich"
descr "With lichcraft, the cunning Necromancer can prolong his life almost indefinitely.  A practical side effect is that most bodily needs present in life no longer take time from studies of the Arts.  The husk of the Lich is quite durable, although over the years some deterioration is inevitable.  Especially the upper and lower lips seem susceptible to decay, which is of little consequence apart from making some incantations a bit harder to utter correctly.  The procedure also requires the heart of the Necromancer to be hidden safely away from enemy mages and would-be heroes."

selectmonster "Demilich"
descr "The Demilich is a Lich that has come to the insight that his physical body is holding him back and stopped maintaining it as he can get by just fine without it.  The only things remaining of his old body are a skull, a few bones and the heart that is still hidden away.  For some reason the heart is still needed if the Demilich should need to reform a few remains and it is only through these remains that the Demilich can still affect this world."

selectmonster "Carrion"
descr "The Carrion is an undead beast with flapping, leathery wings.  Its stench is impressive and the rotting innards will explode in a billowing cloud when the Carrion is destroyed, after which the eldritch energies animating it will work to reassemble the scattered pieces.  This makes it a useful servant for gathering information far and wide."

selectmonster "Raven Spy"
descr "The Raven is a cunning and pleasantly wicked bird.  Properly trained and fed with index fingers from the Hands of Glory, it will bring tidings and reports on far away lands."

selectmonster "Raven Familiar"
descr "Some ravens just refuse to fly away for long, but are constantly drawn back to the Necromantic magics.  These ravens are known as familiars and are almost useless.  At least they can scout the nearby areas, their sharp eyes piercing the disguises of stealthy beings."

selectmonster "Dracolich"
descr "The Dracolich is created through a laborious ritual.  Like its distant kin, the Carrion, its decaying guts provide substrate for the poisonous fumes that billow forth from its mouth and make it explode when destroyed.  It will effectively destroy armies of the living and the poison breath is especially useful against fortifications, where the fumes can reach the battlements.  Unlike the Carrion, the Dracolich will not reassemble.  Nor does it fly."

selectmonster "Ziz"
descr "The Ziz is a Roc that has died and been reanimated by a Necromantic ritual.  The beast is much more useful in its undead form, because it can now drop rocks where the Necromancer wants instead of dropping rocks on random humans."

selectmonster "Abomination"
descr "The Abomination is a huge, amorphous mass of semi-liquefied, dead flesh.  Arms, legs and half-melted heads are extended and retracted from the putrid mass, surrounded by an overpowering smell of decay.  The Abomination will absorb corpses from the ground and slowly grow in power.  If the Abomination should stay on a graveyard or an old battlefield it might take a while to absorb all the dead."

selectmonster "Banshee"
descr "The Banshee is a spirit of the Barrows and her wailing heralds death.  Although usually wearing the visage of an old hag, it is not unheard of her appearing as a maid in mourning, weeping for her lost ones."

selectmonster "Ghost"
descr "Ghosts are usually bound by passion to haunt the living.  Often they are driven by revenge for some wrong done to them in life and many harbor a spiteful wrath against those still full of warmth and vigor."

selectmonster "Ghost Mage"
descr "Ghosts are usually bound by passion to haunt the living.  Often they are driven by revenge for some wrong done to them in life and many harbor a spiteful wrath against those still full of warmth and vigor.^ Ghost Mages were once powerful masters of the Arts, perhaps betrayed by rivals, and now seek the downfall of empires to sate their hunger for vengeance."

selectmonster "Ghost King"
descr "Ghosts are usually bound by passion to haunt the living.  Often they are driven by revenge for some wrong done to them in life and many harbor a spiteful wrath against those still full of warmth and vigor.^ Ghost Kings were once Necromancers of vast power, perhaps betrayed by rivals, and now seek the downfall of empires to sate their hunger for vengeance."

selectmonster "Stygian Ghost"
descr "Some spirits of the Underworld have never been alive.  The Stygian Ghost is a being born of the Underworld, imbued with the powers of unlife.  Most of the Stygian Ghosts serve as magistrates and religious leaders of the cities of the Underworld."

selectmonster "Stygian King"
descr "Some spirits of the Underworld have never been alive.  The Stygian Ghost is a being born of the Underworld, imbued with the powers of unlife.  A few of these beings are endowed with vast power and have made themselves kings of the Underworld.  Their very existence indicates that there is a power greater than Orcus himself influencing the Underworld."

selectmonster "Dispossessed Spirit"
descr "When a mortal dies the body and the soul part.  While the body remains and decomposes in Elysium, the dispossessed spirit travels to the corresponding place in the Underworld, reliving the memories of its last day alive.  If the spirits get lost or if the Veil of the Underworld is thin, these spirits might return to haunt the living.  Dispossessed Spirits may also appear when their bodies are not properly buried, sighing and groaning in the night.  Its touch carries the chill of the Afterlife and its insubstantial form is not easily harmed."

selectmonster "Imperial Spirit"
descr "A wandering spirit drawn to the presence of the rightful Emperor.  The spirit probably didn't get the chance to serve the Emperor in life and thus tries to redeem itself by serving him afterwards instead."

selectmonster "Shade"
descr "While the residual spirits of most deceased mortals are weak and bound by the memories of their living past, there are some that embrace their new existence in the Underworld.  They form insubstantial bodies of malice and shadow.  Aware of their new situation, but bereft of everything they once were, these Shades are empowered by the nature of Hades."

selectmonster "Shade Lord"
descr "Shades were once mortals, but on transition to the Underworld they lost the fetters of their memories and were set free to form insubstantial bodies empowered by dark energies.  When a strong-willed leader dies, the residual spirit may shatter the bonds of its memories and form a shadow-self of greater power innately skilled in dark magics."

selectmonster "Shade Mage"
descr "Shades were once mortals, but on transition to the Underworld they lost the fetters of their memories and were set free to form insubstantial bodies empowered by dark energies.  When a powerful mage dies, the residual spirit may shatter the bonds of its memories and form a shadow-self innately skilled in dark magics."

selectmonster "Dusk Elder"
descr "Dusk Elders are Shade Mages of tremendous power.  Some of them have become rulers of Stygian cities of the Underworld, while others serve as priest-mages of Stygian darkness, serving the Kings of the Underworld."

selectmonster "Wraith"
descr "Wraiths are fearsome, ethereal beings rarely seen in Elysium.  It is the unfettered spirit of a powerful mortal that has bargained with the Underworld, perhaps to avenge its tragic death.  It is more powerful than a Shade and understands its past memories as well as its new existence.  Sometimes the circumstances of the Wraith's demise will allow it to remain in Elysium to wreak havoc on the living.  Wraiths retain the skill of arms they commanded in life and their weapons carry the chill of the Underworld.  They are often skilled in magic, sometimes learned through the centuries following their death."

selectmonster "Wraith Lord"
descr "Wraiths are fearsome, ethereal beings rarely seen in Elysium.  It is the unfettered spirit of a powerful mortal that has bargained with the Underworld, perhaps to avenge its tragic death.  It is more powerful than a Shade and understands its past memories as well as its new existence.^Wraith Lords are Stygian Wraiths strong enough to advance in the hierarchy of Hades and take control over a city or fief of the Underworld.  Others may serve even more powerful entities."

selectmonster "Wraith King"
descr "Wraiths are fearsome, ethereal beings.  Sometimes the tragic death of a powerful mortal will doom him to undeath.  Wraiths retain the skill of arms they commanded in life and their weapons carry the chill of the Underworld.  They are often skilled in magic, sometimes learned through the centuries following their death.^Wraith Kings are ancient Stygian Wraiths that have grown in power over the millennia.  They rule entire regions of the Underworld and are among the most influential of all the entities of Hades."

The taxing incantations and manual work required to exhume and reanimate the Longdead are perhaps best left to the eager apprentice.  Armored longdead are clad in mail and wield a sword."

selectmonster "Bane Fire Archer"

selectmonster "Unfrozen"  # also "Unfrozen Warrior"
descr "The Unfrozen are undead warriors that conquered much of Elysium in the distant past, when the world was young and malleable.  To stop them from destroying the pristine lands, they were imprisoned in glacial ice by primal forces.  The Unfrozen have now been freed and bound by a Necromancer.  The Unfrozen have bony, leathery bodies that withstand damage well.  They fight with ancient stone spears, but some wield magical flint swords created by their mages."

selectmonster "Dire Wolf"
descr "The Dire Wolf is seemingly an ordinary beast, but for some reason it is drawn to Necromancers and their magic.  It is speculated that Dire Wolves are actually dead Wolves that have been reborn as larger beasts and are therefore affected by Necromantic magic."

selectmonster "Death Knight"
descr "The undead are constantly jealous of the living and it is only natural that they should try to create knights of their own.  The somewhat flawed result is the Death Knight, which is more like a mage in armor sitting on a fire breathing horse than any real noble with ideals and honor."

selectmonster "Mirror"  # also "Silver Mirror", "Large Mirror", "Golden Mirror"
descr "Mirrors are the foundation of the Illusionist's power.  Inside the mirrors he can trap magic and images to be released upon enemy armies when the need arises.  There are many different kind of mirrors, each one suited for a special type of Illusionism rituals."

selectmonster "Master Illusionist"
descr "Having perfected the art of performing tricks with mirrors, the able Illusionist can call himself a Master Illusionist.  Having a somewhat loose definition of the truth, it is not a title that is acknowledged by any but the most weak-minded, and several charlatans lacking in ability have claimed this title based on nothing more than smooth words.  It is argued, and I would be prone to agree, that the art of Illusionism is a condition rather than an actual art.  In severe cases of mythomania, the victim spins lies so convincing that he can begin to create such false worlds in papers, in songs and finally in mirrors.  Such hallucinations sometimes spill over into our world, and the Illusionist, standing on the fence between madness and slyness can thus control his lies and hallucination.  Many wounded suitors have found that the person they lusted after was nothing more than just a wicked dream of an Illusionist.  Though I have by no means, regardless of any reputation in the college dorm, encountered such a creature myself, one can only imagine the pain the cruel Illusionist caused his victims as the object of their desire dissipated into thin air when they believed they had finally succeeded in winning the heart of their chosen love."

selectmonster "Illusionist"
descr "The most untrustworthy of all the magicians in this realm, the Illusionist is a spinner of lies, a charlatan and a confidence artist caught in his own web of lies.  Aegeus has written in his ‚ÄùEncyclopediae of Magic Theory‚Äù that Illusionism in no way fills the criteria of being a magical art, but should rather be seen as a form of advanced deception.  Though some have argued that the definition has to be broader than that of Aegeus, almost everyone has some experience with amateur tricks wrought by back room tricksters.  Who among you have not lost money on a card that you were certain had been played already, or come home with a shriveled pumpkin which was just a sorry reflection of the majestically plump specimen you bought at the market?  If that is considered magic, Elysium would soon overflow with second-rate magicians.  The best way to counter the Illusionists' mind tricks is to simply ignore and disbelieve anything they say or do."

selectmonster "Illusionist's Apprentice"
descr "Though most Illusionists must have started their careers as simple street charlatans and tricksters, ready to con you out of every coin, it is a rarely known secret that the apprentice must spend several years perfecting the art of making flawless mirrors.  As the Illusionists are unable to wield any magic themselves, they require perfect mirrors to capture the reflections of the things they wish to conjure."

selectmonster "Floating Eye"
descr "The only known feat of magic that the Illusionist can truly claim is the ability to conjure invisible eyes by which he can spy on the private lives of regular citizens, shying away from neither bedrooms nor privies.  In order to create such eyes, a mixture of soap and mercury is heated in a rune-covered retort until they are both vaporized.  The vapors are then carefully blown through a long silver straw until a bubble forms at the tip.  It is then left to dry in the reflection of the sun in 13 small concave silver mirrors. As the bubble is heated it will float upwards and out in the world."

selectmonster "Archer Illusion"
descr "Looks just like a regular Archer - if the Archer was bluish, paper-thin and possible to see through.  Though our recommendation is to simply ignore them, there have still been some reports of soldiers who have managed to be wounded by them."

descr "Looks just like a regular Monster, only mirrored.  If the troop you meet looks very similar to the rest of the squad, you might be better off ignoring it altogether and even disbelieving that it is there.  At times the Illusionist just gets sloppy, and puts together something that can only be described as a Monster.  Though illusions do not really belong to the arcane arts, one has to admit that it requires a bit of skill to craft the likeness of a real creature, but a general Monster without any distinctive features shows no respect toward the opponent's intelligence and is a sorry display of laziness."

descr "Looks just like a regular Beholder, only mirrored.  It is true that it is very difficult to discern what is left-sided and what is right-sided on a Beholder, as few have survived long enough to perform any more thorough studies.  However, most people seem to conclude that the Beholder is in fact fairly symmetrical, making this method of revealing phantasms somewhat prone to error."

selectmonster "Phase Spider"
descr "The well-known children's chant 'Twinkle, twinkle bitsy spider' most likely refers to the infamous Phase Spider.  Living between worlds, they have the unsettling ability to spin their nets within the Void, capturing any unwarded teleporting traveler coming their way.  At times they will blink into our world and the untrustworthy Illusionist will then lure them through a set of mirrors resembling the Void in order to keep the Phase Spiders in his service."

selectmonster "Displacer Beast"
descr "This feline creature may well be the ancestor of the regular Cat, which can at times randomly display a limited displacement ability when in confined spaces.  The Displacer Beast is far more deliberate in its actions, though still almost impossible to predict.  The cunning and conniving nature of most Illusionists makes them closely associated with this beast and may explain why they have succeeded in befriending the creature.  The Displacer Beast seems to originally come from a world where Cats and catlike creatures are treated with the utmost respect and it rewards any perceived harm to itself or its cousins with tentacled fury.  Anyone who has managed to make a Displacer Beast their pet can expect to find gifts of maimed and half-dead odd creatures from the Void at his doorstep or at the foot of his bed."

selectmonster "Daughter of Dvalin"  # also "Dvala", "Young Dvala"
descr "It is a common misconception that the Dwarven society completely lacks women.  Some scholars have instead speculated that the female dwarf has characteristics that would make them indistinguishable from the Dwarven male.  However, the sudden expansion of their society has given us further insights into this peculiar people.  The Dwarves are in fact ruled by a matron, a Dvala, who seems to be the mother of all the Dwarves from a certain mine.  The College has obtained information revealing that the dwarves all stem from eggs laid by the Dvala.  The Dvala is courted by a handful of drones, a role that is considered the highest honor within the Dwarven society.  If a colony is successful, the queen will spawn a new queen who is ready to populate another mine."

selectmonster "Dwarf Worker"
descr "The newly hatched dwarf quickly takes on the role of a common worker.  At this stage they seem to be of a singular mind, mining away in the depths of the mountain.  Captured specimens have been duly dissected to reveal two vestigial limbs in the lower abdomen.  This has led Agathinus, our lead naturalist, to speculate that the Dwarves are nothing more than an advanced and adapted species of ant.  This view has been refuted some of our herbalists as outrageous.  They in turn claim that Dwarves are just intelligent mushrooms."

selectmonster "Queen's Councilor"
descr "Among the highest ranked in the Dwarf society are the drones who do nothing but eat and mate with the queen.  The stern nature of most dwarves effectively hides that their greatest desire is to frolic about as drones.  A few illustrious drones gain access to not only the queen's body but her mind as well, and take their place as her councilors.  Whenever a new queen is hatched, it is the senior councilor's task to bring the egg to a new mountain.  It is believed that the councilors can communicate with their queen using only their minds and the sound of rocks."

selectmonster "Chosen of Dvalin"
descr "Some of the most special dwarves are the Chosen of Dvalin.  They do not come from the mines like the other dwarves, but rather from the outside world.  Despite this, they are seen as trustworthy individuals that have been chosen by their dwarf god to establish new colonies."

selectmonster "Elder Rune Smith"  # also "Rune Smith"
descr "According to most lore the Dwarves are excellent metal smiths.  Dwarves are closely connected with the mountains and some even say that according to their own myths the queen is married to the mountain where she dwells.  Due to this connection, every Dwarf has an innate understanding of the properties of metal ‚Äì some of our scholars claim that it is due to them consuming metals as we do food.  A rare few have been imbued with the magical properties of the different metals and are able to produce swords, armor, pickaxes and good quality cauldrons.  According to Paetus, it is their loss of a carapace that makes the Dwarfs love a strong armour so highly."

selectmonster "Dwarf"
descr "Neither warrior nor worker, the common Dwarf is sort of Dwarf to be.  At this point they have evolved beyond being mere workers, but their fate is not yet decided by the stone and the queen.  Many of them aid in various tasks, but are strong enough to make formidable fighters."

selectmonster "Dwarf Warrior"
descr "Reading the reports from the Third Mine Wars, where countless Dwarves were captured before the great tragedy, has revealed that it is in their fifth year that it becomes apparent whether a Dwarf is born a fighter or not.  Brought before the queen, the Dwarves are sorted and some are given the standard armor and arms of a Dwarf Warrior."

selectmonster "Rime Warrior"  # also "Rime Brand Warrior", "Furnace Warrior", "Flame Brand Warrior", "Dvalin's Warrior", "Dvalin's Best", "Rime Guard", "Rime Brand Guard", "Furnace Guard", "Flame Brand Guard", "Council Guard"
descr "Some Dwarves have received magic armor and maybe even magic weapons.  This is probably done in recognition of many years of outstanding Dwarf work, or maybe as a reward for a heroic deed in battle.  It is not certain if the magic armor and weapons are actually magic, or if it is only the dwarves that have been enchanted.  What is certain is that the magic weapons are not magic when used by humans."

selectmonster "Dwarf Guard"
descr "A rare sight outside the mines are the Dwarf Guards.  Being a guard is a position of honor among the dwarves and they are given very heavy armor and the important task of guarding the mines and the gold."

selectmonster "Queen's Guard"
descr "Never seen on the regular battlefield are the Queen's Guards.  They were first encountered during the siege of a far off silver mine.  Guarding the queen in almost impenetrable armor was a small but able host of guards.  After a long battle, they drove off the human attackers, which is why we had to resort to magic instead.  Later investigations revealed these guards to be in a position of honor among the Dwarves, appointed directly by the queen."

selectmonster "Dwarf Arbalest"
descr "Some of the warriors are assigned arbalests instead of axes.  In contrast to other societies, it is not considered less honorable to shoot your enemy instead of meeting them in melee.  Axe Dwarves and Arbalest Dwarves are given the same honors before or after a battle.  Some of our scholars believe that it is due to a lack of the concept of honor as we know it among the Dwarves, whilst others maintain that it is their collective nature that makes the idea of duels void."

selectmonster "Rime Branded Arbalest"  # also "Flame Branded Arbalest", "Defender of the Halls"
descr "Some especially nasty Dwarves fire magic bolts with their already powerful arbalests.  Normally enchantments would be made on the weapon to make it magic, but the Dwarves seem to enchant the Dwarf itself instead.  This backward method of enchantment explains why dwarven weapons claimed from the battlefield never fire any magic bolts when used by humans."

selectmonster "Rime Branded Ballista"  # also "Flame Branded Ballista", "Earth Branded Ballista", "Dwarven Ballista"
descr "Every so often the Dwarven mines are beset by ogres, trolls and even giants.  As a last line of defense, there is a mixture of guards and arbalests lining the main chamber.  This is usually only a way to postpone the inevitable, should the giants have reached that far.  However, from time to time a lucky Dwarf might get a fortuitous shot against a giant's head, felling the foul beast.  Should this happen, the Dwarf is immediately taken away, given some privileges and training and set to man some of the ancient ballistas.  A Dwarven ballista need not hit the head in order to defeat a giant.  Despite being vital to the defense of the mines, some have been taken out from the mines in order to be used in sieges against our castles and cities."

selectmonster "Outdoor Dwarf"
descr "Every so often there is a bad egg in the hatchery.  These Dwarves do not fit in with the rest and it is said that they lack the connection to the collective the rest of the Dwarves share, and it is often they who are responsible for the small private stashes that can be found hidden in and around mines.  Though a deviation from the general Dwarf, they have a vital role in dwarven society.  The regular Dwarf would be a poor scout or negotiator, so the Outdoor Dwarves are given the task of dealing with the outside world.  Many of us know the Dwarves to be greedy, nosy, untrustworthy and cruel, but this is most likely due to the fact that we only meet the Outdoor Dwarves, some that have even gone renegade.  While they are widely abhorred in their own society, Naso, our third biologist, claims that the Outdoor Dwarves are increasing in number and might become dominant in the future."

selectmonster "Dwarf Commander"
descr "Every group needs a leader, and so also the Dwarven cohorts.  However, due to their collective nature, most Dwarves are bad leaders and the Outdoor Dwarves even worse despite being individualists.  In order to solve this problem, the Dwarves have come up with a unique method.  Each year three or more of the most loyal warriors are given an unhatched egg from a batch that is believed to become an Outdoor Dwarf, which he then has to eat.  Although a great delicacy, it is not advised to eat more than one.  If all goes well, the Dwarf will then have enough detachment from the collective to be able to lead a group effectively, but not so much that it would be rejected by the regular Dwarves."

selectmonster "Living Boulder"
descr "Controlled by the magic of the Dvala, the living boulders are even more well behaved than regular boulders. They can lie still for years without bothering anyone, although sometimes they move a little at night when no one sees them. But when the mine is attacked they will be the first ones to charge the enemy in an attempt to roll over them."

selectmonster "Ao Oni"  # also "Aka Oni", "Kuro Oni", "Dai Oni"
descr "Oni are ugly, wild demons with pot-bellies and unkempt hair.  They come in different colors and with different abnormalities, but red or green skin with a pair of horns or an extra eye or ear seem to be the most common variants.  Although all Oni enjoys striking people with large clubs, most of them are also capable of dealing pain using their demonic magic.  The Oni have a great appetite and consume all the food and drink they can get hold of.  However, food is also their weakness as they cannot pass a line of carefully arranged potatoes.  Putting a few potatoes on the doorstep is an effective way to keep the Oni out, but on the other hand beasts and especially Bears might be attracted by the potatoes instead."

selectmonster "Spectral Oni"  # also "Spectral Oni General", "Spectral Oni King"
descr "Oni are almost immortal.  When their body is slain, their spirit will live on.  If the spirit is not slain or banished as well, it will reform a new body over time."

selectmonster "Gozu"
descr "The Gozu or Ox-head is a jailer and guardian demon of whatever world this being comes from.  It feeds upon the flesh of deceased sinners in addition to eating all the regular food it can come by.  Its barbed polearm is made to catch souls that try to to escape from their infernal prison."

selectmonster "Mezu"
descr "The Mezu or Horse-face is a jailer and guardian demon of whatever world this being comes from.  It feeds upon the flesh of deceased sinners in addition to eating all the regular food it can come by.  Its barbed polearm is made to catch souls that try to to escape from their infernal prison."

selectmonster "Tengu"  # also "Karasu Tengu", "Konoha Tengu", "Tengu Warrior", "Dai Tengu", "Tengu Weapon Master"
descr "The Tengu has the appearance of a man with the head, hands and feet of a crow.  It might look hideously ugly, but it is still much more civilized than the Oni, which can be seen in the Tengu's use of sophisticated clothes and weapons.  The Tengu is also capable of wielding Storm Magic, with which it can blast its enemies from a distance."

selectmonster "Hannya"
descr "The Hannya is a witch who has made a pact with an Oni King.  In return for her servitude, she is granted magical power and a fire shield to protect her.  The lower body is also replaced with a serpent tail, mostly because the Oni King is tired of all humans looking the same."

selectmonster "Bakemono Sho"
descr "The Bakemono come in many different size, but they are all easily recognized thanks to their ugly, warty appearance. The smallest of their kin are known as the Bakemono-sho.  Size is important for the Bakemono and these small ones are at the very bottom of their primitive society.  They use crude weapons and even a new human recruit would easily beat a few Bakemono Sho in combat."

selectmonster "Bakemono Spearman"  # also "Bakemono Bowman", "Bakemono Soldier", "Bakemono Swordsman", "Bakemono Archer"
descr "The Bakemono come in many different size, but they are all easily recognized thanks to their ugly, warty appearance.  Size is important for the Bakemono and these small ones are far down in their primitive society.  For such a primitive race, they have surprisingly sophisticated weapons and armor, but are still no match for a human soldier."

selectmonster "Bakemono Shaman"  # also "Bakemono Witch Doctor"
descr "The Shaman is the priest or spiritual leader of their primitive cult.  The shamans adorn themselves with feathers, metal trinkets and every piece of junk they can find in order to impress the other Bakemono.  Size is still very important and the larger ones are not likely to be impressed by a shaman unless he is fully loaded with very shiny trinkets."

selectmonster "Dai Bakemono"  # also "Dai Bakemono Archer"
descr "The Dai Bakemono are much larger than the smaller Bakemono, but they are still just as ugly and even more cruel.  Their size has given them high status in the Bakemono tribe and they are usually both well armed and trained for combat."

selectmonster "Bakemono General"
descr "The Bakemono are ruled by the largest and most ruthless of their kin.  A Dai Bakemono who has made himself feared may become a leader and general of the warring Bakemono tribes."

selectmonster "Bakemono Sorceror"  # also "Bakemono Great Sorceror"
descr "Some Dai Bakemono are both evil and cunning and will sequester themselves to study the art of magic.  When they have become old, wise and powerful, they return to lead the bloody cult of the Bakemono, usually after killing the old leader first.  These sorcerers have found the means to summon Oni and coerce them by making large blood sacrifices."

selectmonster "Bakemono Kunshu"  # also "Bakemono O Kunshu"
descr "The Bakemono Kunshu or Bakemono King is an ancient Bakemono who has mastered magic and cheated Death itself.  During his search for sorcerous knowledge, he has discovered the means to hide his own mortality outside his body.  Now he has little to fear from the weapons of men and leads the Bakemono with great confidence."

selectmonster "O Bakemono"
descr "O-Bakemono are huge, lumbering, troll-like Bakemono of great strength, but questionable wits.  They like to make haikus, but rarely manage to remember the first line by the time they begin the second.  Thus their poems often go something like: 'Munch, munch, meat; Uhh ...; Munch, munch, meat; Uhh ...'.  O-Bakemono use heavy clubs and dress in furs and filth."

selectmonster "Shuten Doji"
descr "Shuten-doji are mortal vampires.  They appear as tall old men with fangs and claws, dressed in robes.  Shuten-doji are obsessed with rice.  If presented with spilled rice, they must pick up every grain before they can resume their previous tasks, like running after horrified travelers and such.  Shuten-doji can produce enticing music with their flutes.  They use this power to make visitors fall asleep so they can feast on their blood.  Shuten-doji are feared by most Bakemono and the Bakemono Sorcerors often use them as commanders of their armies."

selectmonster "Uba"  # also "Ghost Cat"
descr "Ubas are malicious old witches who have sided with the Bakemono.  They have some skills in dark magic and coat their daggers in poison.  They are able to take the form of a great black cat in combat."

selectmonster "Kappa"  # also "Kappa Shaman"
descr "The Kappa is a scaled humanoid with a turtle shell on its back.  It is a water-being and haunts rivers and wild coasts.  The Kappa has a water filled depression on the top of its head and if this water is spilled, it loses its strength.  More than all other food, the Kappa loves cucumbers.  If it had enough cucumbers, it would just sit and munch on them and never leave its pond.  Sometimes a clever Kappa takes up residence in a ford and demands cucumbers to allow travelers to cross.  In addition to being a great cucumber eater, the Kappa is also a master of koppo, the bone-breaking technique."

selectmonster "Mujina"
descr "The Mujina is a strange apparition that appears as a comely young maiden dressed in pure white.  When she gets close to her intended target, she reveals her true appearance.  The Mujina is actually faceless and horrible to behold.  The sight of her will make men turn and flee or become mad with fear.  Mujinas like to use their powers to get close to important people and drive them mad or kill them."

selectmonster "Nushi"
descr "The Nushi is a swamp spirit.  It has the appearance of a withered old crone, but takes the appearance of a beautiful woman when in the company of men.  When it strikes, it reverts to the crone form and claws her attackers."

selectmonster "Kitsune"  # also "Fox Spirit"
descr "The Kitsune is a fox spirit.  It has the appearance of a silvery fox with many tails.  It is magically powerful and able to take the appearance of a beautiful woman.  The Kitsune is a trickster and often whimsical or even mischievous in nature.  In human guise they may play pranks on unsuspecting travelers, aid lowborn peasants to greatness or plot the rise or downfall of kingdoms."

selectmonster "Shikome"
descr "The Shikome are hags of the Underworld.  They are sent to hunt down those who try to escape the Land of the Dead.  They appear as mad, starving hags with claws and pointy teeth.  Their claws are able to harm and incapacitate ghosts and spirits.  Shikome are never given food by their cruel lords and they all have an insatiable appetite for the food of the living.  They take every opportunity to feast on flesh or fruits unavailable to them in the halls of the Underworld.  Shikome are the personal servants of the lords of the Underworld and are revered by the Oni."

selectmonster "Troll King"
descr "Today most civilized people do not venture freely into forests or forested mountains.  Forests are treacherous places, dark, damp and filled with bugs and animals, and mountains are no better.  Worse yet are the Trolls that roam the forests and mountain slopes.  Though they are constantly kept at bay by our courageous armies, their brute strength and regenerative powers make them resemble an tenacious weed rather than a regular pest.  Surviving observers claim that the Trolls are led by a king and that in most Troll societies the king is the only male to survive the coming of age rituals.  Dissecting Trolls is a tricky endeavor, as any wounds or cuts tend to close again, and unless destroyed by fire or acid, it is more than likely that the Troll will revive on the dissecting table ‚Äì which proved fatal to Lania the Anatomist.  Still, some of the dissections seem to indicate that the younger Trolls, which make up most of the fireball fodder in a Troll army, lack any gender.  This may confirm some stories that claim that the king will kill all other male Trolls and, if defeated, a new king will rise.  ^ Mocking the regalia of our own nobility, the Troll King dons a crown, crudely hammered together from gold wares, and sits upon a stone throne using his gigantic club as a sceptre when he is not out fighting battles.  As his great strength is only matched by his lack of sagacity, rulings by the Troll King are arbitrary at best, at least as long as his mother is not present.  Visitors are advised to bring gifts to the king, preferably fair princesses, but other valuable gifts may also suffice.  However, should you be in the position to need an audience with the Troll King, avoid bringing a live Goat as a gift, or at all, as this seems to throw the Troll King in to a fit of murderous rage."

selectmonster "Old Troll"
descr "Fighting Trolls is a difficult matter as they do not follow any basic rules of warfare.  However, there is one thing one should always keep in mind, and that is never to send any heroes to fight the Trolls.  In the Troll battles of Bingham Bridge, Theofrastus III sent in a group of well known heroes to the Troll King's lair in order quickly end the war.  At first it seemed a success, as the surviving heroes brought back the Troll King's still twitching arm as a trophy of their victory.  It has later been concluded that the following disaster was due to the Troll King's Mother entering the fray of the battle.  Although the female Trolls are less bellicose than the male Troll, they are very protective and maternal towards their offspring. "

selectmonster "Ancient Troll"
descr "Few have met a female Troll and survived, because most such unfortunates will be devoured in one of many creative ways.  Though Troll cuisine can often be seen as rather simple, they appear to have a preference for human flesh, which they prepare in many ingenious ways.  Lady Eradeth of Bingham, who managed to flee after a three year long captivity, reported on how the lesser Forest Trolls go to great lengths to prepare puddings, pies, small fritters and other dishes out of human flesh.  Though she claims to not have tasted any of them, she did develop some unnatural cravings later in her life.  However, the culinary endeavors of the Ancient Troll are limited to crushing corpses with a mortar and pestle or throwing them whole into her large cauldron.  The secret of a good Troll mead are a few crushed farmers that go into the brew. "

selectmonster "Ettin"
descr "It is easy to imagine that two brains would be smarter than one.  The case of the Ettin proves that notion wrong.  Troll-kin are not renowned for their intellectual capabilities and many stories tell us about how Trolls are easily fooled by quick-thinking pig herds or others that get a chance to pass them.  Ettins seem to be even worse off.  Magus Philosoficus Asina at our College launched the theory that most supernatural forces will redirect or reshape reality rather than create new things or forces.  As such, a supernatural creature with two heads will have half the mental ability of a creature with just one.  This claim was vehemently opposed by her colleague Ambustus.  In order to prove her point, Asina performed a ritual that split Ambustus into two smaller versions of him, and he, or rather, they, refuted the theory by creating a ball of fire that burnt Asina to a cinder. ^ When it comes to the Ettin, it does seem to have half the brain of an ordinary Troll and is easily fooled.  The origin of the Ettin is unknown, but some stories claim that it was originally a Giant who was given two equally convincing opposed views to ponder by a captured orator.  According to the same story, the Giant got a splitting headache that turned out to be quite literal."

selectmonster "Forest Troll"
descr "Few good things have ever come out of the forests, and worst among the pests are the Forest Trolls.  Being present in most forests, they feed on unaware travelers and raid nearby farms - luckily they are not as powerful as many of their cousins.  According to most sources, they are considered the runt in the family and are often beaten by their stronger brethren.  Though they seem to be even more lacking in wits than any other Troll-kin - perhaps with the exception of Ettins, they somehow seem to have been gifted with a knack for cooking.  When not abducting humans, careful hunters have seen them gathering moss, crow eggs, purple berries and small rocks which everyone knows are used in their culinary practices.  At times Forest Trolls have been found chained to a cauldron in other Troll tribes.  It is said that some of the dishes prepared by a Forest Troll are highly sought after even among human gourmands.  However, such vile desires will of course only end in disaster, as was shown in the court of Baron von Helmstedt, who had captured a Forest Troll and added it to his kitchen staff in order to be able to serve such delicacies.  A scandal that involved a few missing children, some cracked teeth and a serious case of food poisoning at his mother's funeral proved him fatally wrong."

selectmonster "Rock Troll"
descr "Just as some Trolls reportedly mainly live in the forest, a somewhat stronger variety can be found near cliffs and in hilly terrain.  Though slower than the Forest Trolls, they tend to blend into the surrounding landscape and are thus almost impossible to detect until they stand over you, trying to rip off your limbs.  Standing prone for months on end, they often have moss or grass growing on them, hiding them even better.  Their rocky surface make them difficult to damage with swords or spears.  Clubs, pickaxes and even better, explosive magic, is to be preferred.  A very successful combination of ice and fire magic has been tested out on a captured Rock Troll in this College's very cellar.  Their regenerative abilities make them excellent test subjects, as they do not tend to die from one experiment to the next.  When making experiments on Trolls, one has to make sure to have a large enough pool of guards.  Further investigations have also revealed that these younger Trolls lack any gender, which seems to develop only at a later stage."

selectmonster "Troll"
descr "When the trolls grow older they grow bigger, meaner and more desolate.  At this stage the Trolls seem to prefer dark, damp spaces, mainly dark caverns, but they can also be found under bridges, in sewers and even the occasional cellar.  It is always advisable to avoid sending wanted children and pets into unknown basements by themselves.  The easiest way to draw out these pests ‚Äì the Trolls - is through a well planned trail of gold.  Just make sure that there is a group of well armed adventures by the end of the trail, because leading a Troll into a neighbor's basement is in most civilized cities considered a capital offense.  The Troll can easily be found either by its smell, which can be described as fermenting rats, or by sound, which surprisingly enough is a rather pleasing baritone.  It has been speculated that there is a vague relation between Trolls and Sirens due to this.  But even if the Troll song is used to lure unsuspecting passersby, there is nothing in either physiognomy or internal organs that seem to indicate any kinship.  It is possible that it is the large cavities within the Troll's body that act as a sounding board, giving us an illusion of a good voice.  "

selectmonster "Forest Giant"
descr "Though not really part of the Troll-kin, the Giants that survive into these days feel most closely aligned with the Trolls.  The Forest Giants are a bit more reclusive than their cousins, and spend most days wandering the forests longing for the ancient days when their ancestors ruled Elysium.  Though smaller than their cousins, they see themselves as the keepers of Giant memories.  However, just like most Giants and Trolls, their memory is somewhat lacking and their oratory skills leave something to be desired, which leaves their lore and sagas to be an ever shifting and jumbled mess.  The only thing that keeps them from being completely mutated is the rather long lives of most giants.  "

selectmonster "Hill Giant"
descr "The largest of giantkind see themselves as the Barons of the Troll realm.  They prefer to settle in old ruins and fortresses where they act like some kind of feudal lord, demanding food from the neighboring peasants.  To live in an area with a resident Hill Giant that is not taken care of by the local lord is in many places considered legal grounds for peasants to abandon their lands and not pay any taxes set by their regular lord.  Some particularly malicious farmers have seen this as an opportunity to access more lands as others move out.  Usually such an arrangement would have to include the delivery of human corpses, making so called Giant tenants particularly disliked.  Since the Hill Giants have a very high opinion of themselves, it makes them difficult allies for the Trolls and they have to be coerced with gold or promises of a greater castle in order to follow the armies and not go on private raiding sprees."

selectmonster "Ogre"
descr "The smallest of the Giants lives in small tribes that often raid our farmlands.  Having had a close relationship with Trolls and Hill Giants, they have developed a dire craving for human flesh, but in being more cunning than their cousins, they often execute well planned raids on human villages or waylay travelers at crossroads in order to fill up their larders.  While Trolls seem to prefer females of noble blood, Ogres make no such distinction, and if anything they prefer a plump merchant to a skinny princess.  It is said that Ogres were originally a crossbreed between humans and giants, and while our anatomists claim that such a coupling would be impossible, the Ogres are more cunning than their brethren and sometimes an Ogre is born that looks almost human.  Another theory that has been recently investigated is that the Ogres were once a human tribe that has changed due to their proximity to Giants and the magical nature of their lands.  Regardless of their origin, travelers in the outskirts of the realm are well advised to avoid any offers from a large, oafish looking merchant or innkeeper to taste their confit de marchand."

selectmonster "Ogre Chief"
descr "Lacking any lineage or any other civilized traits, while having weakness for gambling, the Ogre tribes have a rather unique way of choosing their leaders - they choose them by drawing lots.  The exact way that the lot is drawn changes from time to time as the current leader can choose if the lot or gamble will use dice, cards or just colored rocks.  Depending on the leader's choice, the process can take everything from a few minutes to several weeks.  Since the rules state that it has to be a gamble, the loser will be sacrificed to their gods, the exact way being chosen by a number die and can range from ritual dismemberment to being slowly crushed by rocks to being eaten by the tribe.  This mandatory gamble has led to the Ogres at times being led by the least worthy but most lucky member of the tribe.  Considering gambling a holy act, any human who wants to participate is allowed to do so, and throughout history there have been instances of notorious bandits leading Ogre tribes."

selectmonster "Troll Shaman"
descr "During the first Troll Wars, the Troll Witch Doctors and Shamans caused some confusion among the civilized troops.  Although in appearance and action they appeared to be the feared female Trolls, upon closer inspection they turned out to be male.  It is uncertain if this was a response to the lack of female Trolls or a survival strategy for the males. ^ When the Trolls grow older, they will at some point be given their gender.  However, since there can only be one Troll King, the rest will either be eaten or if they for some reason, through age or pure luck are wittier they will take on a role that in many ways resemble that of the old female Troll.  This does not only limit itself to the use of magic but also the way they act and dress."

selectmonster "Troll Witch Doctor"
descr "At some stage the Troll Shamans are considered to be females by the rest of the tribe and given the same respect as the Troll Mother. In order to elevate themselves to Witch Doctors, the Troll Shamans will have to perform a ritual that includes self-castration.  In order for their parts not to grow back or reattach, they are ritually cooked and eaten by the Witch Doctor.  After this point they believe that their magic is concentrated and they can perform more intricate rituals.  Some human mages have tried to duplicate this ritual in order to concentrate their magic, but being based on superstition and unscientific measures, the only result was pain and ridicule."

selectmonster "Elder Troll Shaman"
descr "There have been observations on ancient shamans that are almost indistinguishable from the ancient Mother Troll, were it not for their tendency to talk to themselves or invisible creatures around them.  Some claim that they do indeed speak with the ancestral Trolls whose bodies have disintegrated through time, while others would more logically contend that the ancient shamans could be speaking with anything except a Goat and the Troll King would accept it as something to be revered.  whether it is age or a strange ritual that will give the elder shaman his power is unclear, though some claim that there is indeed a ritual in which the Troll King will confirm the gender role of the shaman, but it would not be advisable for the sake of either life or sanity to try to observe such a ritual."

selectmonster "Lake Troll King"  # also "Lake Troll Warrior", "Lake Troll"
descr "Most Trolls like damp places at some stage in their life, but some Trolls just can't get enough of it and start to live in lakes instead of the usual damp cellars.  As Trolls normally can't breathe water, it is assumed that the Trolls would die underwater if it weren't for their regenerative powers.  But after a long time underwater even a relatively daft troll should have learned how to breathe water properly.  Just like normal Trolls, the Lake Trolls can be quite aggressive and it is advised to stay well away from their favorite lake.  Tossing a gold coin into the lake is not recommended as even a Troll might figure out that the person throwing away perfectly good gold could have more coins on him."

selectmonster "Goblin"  # also "Goblin Spearman", "Goblin Archer", "Goblin Chieftain", "Goblin Hero", "Goblin Murderer"
descr "Goblins are cowardly creatures of low morals and limited intelligence that like to skulk around in the forests where they can stay hidden from their foes.  The Goblins would be totally harmless if it weren't for their strange alliance with the Trolls.  The Trolls can find the Goblins with their excellent sense of smell and this is the foundation for the alliance.  The Goblins serve the Trolls and in return the Trolls don't kill all the Goblins."

selectmonster "Goblin King"
descr "King of all the Goblins, that is a title of dubious value.  Maybe it will add up to something if you are king of really many Goblins.  Still, Goblins are of a very low intellect and it is unlikely they will get organized enough to form a large kingdom."

selectmonster "Goblin Shaman"  # also "Goblin Witch Doctor"
descr "Following the Trollish ritual of self mutilation, the Goblin Shamans mutilate themselves as soon as they decide that becoming a shaman would be fun.  Maybe it is this that gives them their power, or maybe it is because they have seen how the previous Shaman performed his rituals.  Regardless, reports say that the Goblin Shamans can actually perform magic, despite their low intellect and nonexistent training."

selectmonster "Shadow Tree"
descr "That shadow tree might look like any other dead tree from a distance, but those who get too close will soon realize that it is both alive and angry. Any tree that is alive will be a very formidable foe as it is huge with thick bark and has plenty of thick branches to attack with."

selectmonster "Burgmeister"
descr "The Hoburghers are generally considered jovial, friendly and industrious but somewhat na√Øve.  According to Bibula the Nauseated, this view is completely wrong.  Her close study of the Hoburg society presents them as driven by greed and hunger, with a slight contempt for the rest of the world.  Although originally an agricultural society, they have recently transitioned to an urban society with a focus on refining their produce and manufactured goods.  Their lack of understanding of any higher form of magic has led them to tinker with cogs and wheels.  At first glance the Hoburg village may appear peaceful, picturesque and welcoming, but Bibula concludes that one need only spend a few hours there to realize that everything is too small except the meals, which are instead overdimensioned, sickly sweet and far too greasy.  On anything but the windiest of days, soon a thick smog will settle over the Hoburg villages and towns.  The Hoburghers also have the strangest fashion of choosing their leader.  Instead of basing it on birthright or divine favor as any civilized nation would, or on contest as in the barbaric countries, the Hoburghers instead elect their leaders based on who is the wealthiest among them."

selectmonster "Kaiser"  # also "Malefic Kaiser"
descr "Generation of fighting between human dukes and self proclaimed royalties left humankind weakened and it was up to the Hoburghers to construct the new capital of the new Empire.  Many people were surprised when a Hoburgher proclaimed himself Kaiser and supreme ruler over Elysium, but those more well educated knows that Hoburghers are both hard working and clever.  The Kaiser has issued coins with his portrait and made it mandatory to own an image of him, as is tradition.  We can conclude that the Kaiser is rightfully appointed and wish him all luck in his rule."

selectmonster "Leibwache"
descr "The Leibwache is the best of the best of Hoburg Soldiers and they are entrusted with guarding the Kaiser's life.  Being selected for this guard is a great honor and comes with the privilege of getting to eat the same food as the Kaiser."

selectmonster "Horticulturist"
descr "Since the Hoburghers are being plagued by a constant cough due to the heavy smog that has settled over their villages of late, the Horticulturist and the herbs he can provide to relieve such conditions are highly valued.  The Horticulturist also plays a vital role in providing the society with various herbs for flavor, pleasure or political schemes.  Because the Hoburghers are obsessed with food and drink, such herbs are widely sought after, and lucky is the brewer who can get a hold of the secret herb mixture or fruit of a Hoburgher Horticulturist.  Though Hoburg beer is widely popular and carries a high price across the world, there are some who think that the herbs in the beer are highly addictive and as such are the main weapon of the Hoburg nation.  It is rumored that at times the Horticulturist will visit lonely but fertile farms with a special brew.  Soon after the inhabitants are addicted to the drink and are easily moved out from the farm, and not long after a thriving Hoburg village will spring up."

selectmonster "Garden Master"
descr "Tending the Burgmeister's gardens is the Garden Master, a Horticulturist who has dedicated his or her life to the study of the intricacies of plantlife in further detail.  While maintaining a beautiful garden, the Garden Master will also introduce strange and exotic plants in the Garden to study the ways they can be used.  It is well known that they still maintain the ancient ritual of calling the Forest Guardians, strong treelike creatures, to the defense of the Hoburg villages, should an overwhelming danger arise.  This bond with the forest stems from an ancient time when the Hoburghers were more in tune with the Nature around them.  At times the Garden Masters will travel the known world's colleges and universities in pursuit of more knowledge.  From various forgotten or recently discovered notebooks it has been possible to discern a peculiar interest in fertilization.  Though our scholars have had no opportunity to sample the soil there, Bibula has put forth the theory that the Hoburg heartlands are all worn out due to the high yields that have been demanded from the soil there, and the foul remains pouring out from the new manufacturies."

selectmonster "Horologist"
descr "In the words of Metucullus the Chronomancer, ‚Äúthe foundation of any good business is to control time‚Äù.  Though his practice of manipulating the horse market through time travel is generally frowned upon, it still rings true for most manufacturers.  This rings even more true in the Hoburg manufacturies where the many food related pauses could bring any production to a halt should the pauses be uncontrolled.  Trying to solve this problem in various ways, now most manufacturers have chosen to employ the powers of the Horologist, filling their workspace with clocks and watches.  The knowledge of cogs, wheels and springs also make them apt at improving the various equipment at the facilities.  It is said that the whole industrial eruption was started by Konradin the Gilded, a Horologist who constructed the ‚ÄúChurning Esmeralda‚Äù, a machine that could produce large amounts of butter in no time."

selectmonster "Clockwork Master Crafter"
descr "Taking the craft of the Horologist to another level is the Clockwork Master Crafter.  Though there are crafters and clockmakers elsewhere who have produced exquisite clockwork musicians or chess players, most have just seen it as a form of entertainment with no further consequence.  Among the Hoburghers, however, the clockwork worker was a way of expanding their manufactories when there was a lack of workers.  Though mainly confined to their manufactories, some rumors claim that the increasingly aggressive Hoburghers now employ Clockwork Soldiers in their armies.  Though not officially acknowledged, it came under suspicion as a group of Hoburgher fighters were never seen eating during a siege in Lower Ferovia, and it was somewhat confirmed as the same troops continued fighting even after literally losing their heads."

selectmonster "Hoburg Militia"
descr "To gather any larger group of Hoburghers can often prove to be an insurmountable task, something that can be seen in the traditional Hoburg defense force, the militia.  The militia consists of the free Hoburghers gathering every Sunday to parade with crude metal helmets and eat fruitcake.  The militia is usually a sorry sight and do not provide much is terms of fighting power.  Being badly armed and small in stature, they offer no real resistance.  It is often assumed that the compact stature of the Hoburghers originates from their close affinity with the earth that they traditionally toil, as it tries to pull them back down.  However, some studies of their earlier history have revealed partial evidence that they originally lived in burrows, living off of worms and dead animals.  It is possible that their great appetite stems from this earlier constant hunger."

selectmonster "Hoburg Slinger"
descr "The rural militia is often supported by a group of Hoburgher slingers, who are generally the local poachers banding together for training days.  While the militia is a sorry lot, the slingers are instead deadly shots as long as they are sober, which would be a rare find on any given Sunday.  However, their poaching gives them more enough time to practice."

selectmonster "Hoburg Soldier"
descr "As the Hoburg nation is getting more and more organized, so is their army.  Better armed and more organized than the militia, the soldiers provide more of a fight but is a nightmare to lead due to the logistics problems associated with any Hoburg army.  Not only are they dependent on the constant replenishment of their supplies, but the army will move painfully slow over any terrain.  It is often believed to be due to their small stature and short legs, but that notion has often been proved wrong when encountering Hoburghers in a fight.  A more likely reason for the slow pace is the many food stops.  On any given day the average Hoburgher will eat six meals, not counting snacks or informal get-togethers, or food eaten on the go.  There are many theories about the reason for the constant hunger of the Hoburgher, and some failed attempts at curing them.  Some believe it to be due to the magic deficiency present in many Hoburghers, a deficiency said to originate from an small portal inside them through which both food and magic are drained to another plane of existence.  This is of course nonsense and many learned scholars of today have concluded that they must be inhabited by a small daemonic parasite, much like the more mundane parasites that can be found in various cattle."

selectmonster "Hoburg Defender"
descr "As most Hoburghers care most about their home and hearth, the Hoburg Defender is the part of the army that sees the most volunteers.  Some would however say that it is the close proximity of their and their neighbors' larders that draws the volunteers to join their ranks.  Provided with a short sword, they are meant to defend the houses, alleys and narrow streets of the villages and townships."

selectmonster "Hoburg Crossbow"
descr "Among the more prominent Hoburg citizens a popular sport is wyvern shooting.  Though it is said to be a tradition that originated with an actual wyvern attack on Kuchendorf some forty years ago, today it only consists of a small silver wyvern on a high pole, which the Hoburghers take turns to try to shoot down.  The winner is given a wyvern medallion that is worn to impress their neighbors.  Some of these wyvern shoot winners form the core of the crossbowmen in the Hoburg army."

selectmonster "Hoburg Pikeneer"
descr "For many years the Hoburg army was easy prey to any heavy cavalry, especially the heavily armored knights.  However, using their cunning, technical aptitude and general fear of being killed, they soon came up with a plot to fight their mounted foes.  By combining long pikes with the firm foundation provided with a low center of mass and large feet, they were able to stop even the most well armored cavalry."

selectmonster "Burgmeister Guard"
descr "In the great Hoburg hall the Burgmeister is protected by a selected elite of Hoburg Defenders.  This guard will follow the Burgmeister everywhere he goes, offering protection with their lives and armor.  Some people have complained that the Guard provides the Burgmeister with undue business advantages, as they are not shy of using power to enforce deals.  Such complaints seem to have a tendency to go away after being uttered once.  Unique among the Hoburg troops is a clause in their contract which says that the Burgmeister Guard may never go hungry.  The costs of the Guard are currently half of the budget for the whole army.  The Burgmeister Guard can be recognized by their gaudy red berets, golden breastplates and fancy pants made of several different fabrics."

selectmonster "Hog Knight"
descr "Where other nations consider the horse the foremost of animals, the Hoburghers are most closely associated with the swine.  The priced hogs are more than just a favorite food.  In many Hoburg towns one should not be surprised to see a family outing with a hog on a leash accompanying them and participating in the traditional pie eating.  A matter of pride for many Hoburg farmers is the yearly ‚Äúfattening the hog‚Äù competition, in which the farmers with the fattest pigs of different ages win recognition and a fine trophy.  From Schmalzburg comes the sow butter, which is widely acclaimed among Hoburghers.  During the Troll Wars some of the richest pig-farmers gathered together and set up a well armed unit that rode on a particularly fierce breed of hogs.  The hog used for this unit is usually co-bred with wild boars in order to provide a gamier taste to the Dark Forest smoked ham.  Though expensive, the peppery sweetness of the well larded ham is not something one ought to miss out on."

selectmonster "Hogmeister"
descr "The leader of a unit of Hog Knights is the Hogmeister.  The Hogmeister usually comes from among the sons and daughters of the pig breeders who set up the Hog Knight units and are usually better armed and more well trained than their troops.  Anyone who has met a Hogmeister can also confirm that they are arrogant, unbearable snobs who smell like a pigsty."

selectmonster "Ruby Clockwork Soldier"
descr "The first troop constructed by the Horologist was a simple clockwork soldier planned to make a display at the clock tower outside the Burgmeister's residence.  In order to make the display a bit more lively, the mechanical soldier was adorned with a small ruby imbued with fire.  Though this resulted in the belfry being burnt to the ground, the Burgmeister could see the strategic implications of the clockwork constructs and ordered the  Horologist to make more."

selectmonster "Sapphire Clockwork Soldier"
descr "It is quite easy to notice if an approaching Hoburg army contains a Horologist due to the clanking sound of his many Clockwork Soldiers.  Though clunky and erratic, they make a very good addition to the army as they can man the first line of battle while the Hoburghers finish their pie and beer snack. ^The constructs are all powered by a large mainspring and a jewel imbued with a certain element.  Before battle all constructs have to be wound up and the jewels have to placed in the right place, which is why it is preferable to attack the Hoburg forces by surprise.  As everyone knows, the sapphire is connected with the Plane of Water and, when used in a construct, it will shoot forth a jet of ice cold water that paralyzes the victim.^ Being a superstitious lot, the different Barbarians fear the constructs in the Hoburg armies and will likely break if they meet a large group of constructs.  During their wars against the Barbarians, the small unwalled village Kopfdorf faced almost certain destruction at the hands of a Barbarian raiding party.  While the village elders despaired and tried to find ways to escape, the apprentices of the local workshops together with some farmhands dressed up in discarded bits of clockwork constructs because they could find no armor and moved outside the village to make a desperate last stand.  The Barbarians saw the strange and unbendy movement of the metal figures, and assuming that it was an army of constructs, promptly retreated."

It has been speculated that it should possible to increase the power of the lightning by directing it towards another Clockwork Soldier, thus charging the diamond in that construct and producing an even more powerful lightning bolt.  This theory was meant to be tried out by Ortolf the Master Horologist at the battle of Sahnenburg, where he had placed twenty constructs in a circle, meaning for them to charge each other for a few rounds before the resulting lightning should have been directed towards the enemy.  The result of the experiment is not known, as neither of the opposing armies nor Sahnenburg could be found afterwards."

descr "Some of the constructs made by the Horologist lack the creative touch of a true artist, but are more or less basic soldiers upon which patches of metal and a pair of deadly blades have been attached.

selectmonster "Iron Fly"
descr "According to the accounts of the head Horologist, the Iron Fly was intended to be a flying annoyance to the regular troops, particularly useful against archers.  He disputes any claims that he can use the the Iron Flies to spy on ordinary Hoburg citizens, saying that he has no way of seeing through the eyes of iron flies with the help of mirrors or other scrying devices.  That an Iron Fly has been seen hovering just outside the window of the changing room for the contestant of the Miss Pumpkin contest is a just a mere coincidence and should not be given any consideration."

selectmonster "Iron Spider"
descr "Why one would choose to make a construct with a spider shape is beyond most civilized minds.  Certainly they have some advantages of climbing walls and spewing out some kind of sticky paralyzing sustenance, but no serious craftsman or magician would choose such a form for their constructs.  This shows that the creative art of the Hoburg crafter is inferior to his peers in other societies.  Should the Empire spend its time at making constructs, undoubtedly some more artistic expressions than spiders would emerge."

selectmonster "Iron Ant"
descr "A major problem with the soldier constructs was found during a battle that was fought on the rocky slopes of Rusty Mountains, when the Dwarven troops realized that the soldier constructs were easily toppled.  When they fell on their backs, they had problems getting back on their feet, because of their considerable weight.  A temporary solution was to give the soldier and horror constructs a third or even fourth leg, but they proved difficult to manage and they could walk of in the wrong direction in the middle of a fight.  A better solution was suggested by an apprentice who made some clockwork toy insects for the local clockwork toy construct races, and noted how his ants and bugs were much more difficult to topple by tilting the board or blowing hard on them.  His ideas were then promptly stolen by the senior Horologist."

selectmonster "Iron Scorpion"
descr "Serving originally as part of a trade deal to a powerful southern merchant, the Scorpion constructs were based upon the more common Ant construct, but with the added bonus of a poisonous sting.  However, the deal went sour when some fingers were found in the fish pickles that the Hoburghers had traded.  Now the Iron Scorpions instead serve the army and with their outlandish looks, they are quite popular in military parades."

selectmonster "Markgraf"
descr "Despite the apparent coherence of the Hoburg society, there is some opposition to the current order.  Being bested in an election to the title of Burgmeister, the ancestor of the current Markgraf decided to withdraw himself from the Hoburg society altogether, setting up his domain as that of a Graf, modeled on the human Barons.  For a few generations this remote area of the Hoburg society was more or less self-sufficient, if a bit leaner than their neighbors.  The Markgraf managed to live well off of his subjects and no dissenters to his rule survived to tell any tales.  Many Hoburghers of ill repute have found a refuge in the towns of the Markgrafdom, which had already broken with the customs of the Hoburg society.  As the Markgraf's domains are more barren and worn down than the rest the Hoburg lands, the Markgrafs have tried every means available to improve the lot of their subjects and themselves."

selectmonster "Malefic Markgraf"
descr "Though it long appeared as if the Nekromants in fact ruled the Markgraf's domains, some recent news seem to indicate that the Markgraf was indeed in control the whole time, or at least tried to be.  Spending the money earned from manufactures and settled lawsuits on research in order to investigate an old rumor in the Markgraf annals, he hoped to gain power for himself.  We at the College of Cerebro Magni were happy to be able to present the results of our studies, which indicated that the Nekromant could aid the Markgraf in achieving a status of powerful undeath.  The disadvantage being that he requires the blood of living people on a constant basis, though not necessarily that of Hoburghers.  There are some uncertainties as to how he received our results, because the envoys that were sent with the results seem to have disappeared during their travels.  However, the Markgraf has since paid the monies due and even offered a stipend for young scholars to travel to the Markgrafdom to study."

selectmonster "Malefic Master"
descr "Though the original vampiric Markgraf was rather limited in his resources, he retained the immense hunger of his kind.  According to some bookkeeping that reached our College, the Markfgraf seemed to have spent most of the revenues of his undead factories importing a steady run of black sausage, black pudding and fresh pig's blood from their Hoburg neighbors.  This in combination with a steady decline in population in the villages seems to indicate that the Markgraf tried to satiate his hunger with blood.  Though no study by itself seems to indicate that an increased intake of blood would help developing vampiric abilities, at best it would placate an ordinary Vampire, while a regular Hoburgher would just be nauseated, if not full.  The reason may instead be found in the fake blood produced by the Horticulturist in order to water down the blood barrels.  Though the herbal mixtures could not be shown to have provided any benefit in smaller amounts, or even normal amounts, it is possible that a high concentration of the herbal mixture would make a difference."

selectmonster "Malefic Markmeister"
descr "Some of the most loyal Markmeisters are known to be offered eternal life by their vampiric master.  As could be expected from such a magically inept race, the ritual does not completely transform the former Markmeisters, and in addition to their great craving for blood, the lesser Markmeisters retain a huger, which they sate with the consumption of blood sausages, black bread and blood soup.  Far from distancing them from the other Markmeisters, this has given rise to a trend where blood sausages are all the rage among the more socially inclined Markmeisters."

selectmonster "Nekromant"
descr "It is believed that the Nekromants established themselves in the Markgrafdom a few decades ago, after being banned in Hoburg.  Though the Hoburghers generally lack an understanding and prowess in the arts of magic, some seem to still have an understanding for the art of Necromancy, perhaps due to their close association with the soil.  A few years ago there was even a Hoburg Necromancer, Sigismunda Strobel, at this very College, who was not without insight into the Dark Arts.  Recently the Nekromants gained access to the Markgraf's council, because they cooperated in finding a way to copy the Hoburg manufacturies.  Being well-versed in the art of preservation, one of the first manufacturies to be populated solely by undead workers was the manufactury of 'Hermann Fleischer's Fine Pickled Meats'.  There were some complaints of fingers in the pickles, which pitched the Markgraf into a lengthy legal battle with the Fleischer family."

selectmonster "Grand Nekromant"
descr "Some rumors claim that after the Markgraf's Nekromant aide performed the ritual that allowed him to advance in the necromantic arts, it is the Grand Nekromant who is the actual ruler of the Markfgrafdom.  This claim is of course widely denounced by both the Markgraf and the Grand Nekromant.  Nevertheless, some worrying reports talk about large amounts of armed and armored small skeletons among the graveyards in the Markgrafdom.  However, reports are difficult to come by, because most of the citizens of the Markgrafdom know to keep quiet and will close their doors to any visiting strangers."

selectmonster "Corpse Nekromant"
descr "It is said that the main reason for learning the art of Necromancy - apart from the ability to command large number of troops for only the minor cost of being shunned by friends and loved ones ‚Äì is the ability to cheat death.  However, the Nekromant's ability to cheat death differs somewhat from their full Necromancer counterparts.  Being more associated with the soil and earth than arcane magics, the result of the twice-born ritual is a regular corpse with some remembrance of their former life."

selectmonster "Wight Nekromant"
descr "In the taverns of the Markgrafdom there are whispers of a powerful undead Nekromant with magic powers resembling those of the most powerful Necromancers.  Henning the Witch Hunter tried to sort through the rumors, but being a stranger, the locals all went quiet when they met him.  What he could find out before he disappeared was that even though the former councilor of the Markgraf died during their latest campaign, he has still been seen whispering malicious advice to the Markgraf's ear."

selectmonster "Small Ghost"
descr "Though not considerably ancient, the circle of Nekromants in the Markgrafdom has tried to copy the late and present Necromantic cult in Mons Osseus, by keeping a council of the already dead Nekromants.  In order to avoid the usual problem of lost body parts and sometimes the botched hunger of the undead, the Nekromants developed a ritual involving a graveyard, some strong Hoburg ale, incense and a very sweet pie to to turn the twicedead into ghosts, separating their body from their soul.  However, the scheme failed, because the ghostly remains could not be contained, and the Ghosts would bicker incessantly, forcing the Nekromants to move their premises."

selectmonster "Ghost Nekromant"
descr "The most powerful of the ethereal undead Nekromants are called Ghost Nekromants, because they ignore the fact that they are dead and continue on as before, with the only difference that they now can spy on their subjects and walk through walls."

selectmonster "Hoburg Thrall"
descr "Though some loyalty can be expected from the regular troops due to good pay, plentiful food and some good loot, nothing makes your troops as loyal as good old mind control.  During extensive trials it has been proven that in 75 out of 80 cases the Thrall or mindcontrolled unit will not react or disobey in deadly situations, as opposed to a 20 of 80 result when just using regular methods of command.  There is of course a lack of initiative from the Thrall, which is why they are often set to death-defying simple missions.  Some adversaries to the method do point out that it is not an economically sound way of leading troops, even though they need not be paid."

selectmonster "Hobmark Soldier"
descr "In many aspects the Hobmark troops are more or less copies of the Hoburgher regiments, albeit paler of skin and with less colorful garb.  The soldiers are mainly forced volunteers and though being far more independent than the Thralls, they are also far more prone to act randomly, a flaw that is readily pointed out by the Nekromants."

selectmonster "Hobmark Defender"
descr "Some of the more loyal troops are both better paid and better armored.  Though their regular role is to defend the villages and towns, they are given special training to deal with upset Hobmark farmers carrying pitchforks and torches.  So far only lesser members of the Markgraf family have been burned at the stake, which has of course been followed with an appropriate response from the Defenders."

selectmonster "Hobmark Crossbow"
descr "It has also been noted that the Markgraf has copied the foremost missile troops of the Hoburg.  This is news that should be heeded with some caution as crossbows bolts aren't any more effective against peasant rabble or an erring undead."

selectmonster "Hobmark Hammerer"
descr "The troop that differ most from what you can find in the Hoburg regiments is the Hammerer.  Though such news rarely make it out of the Markgraf's domains it is said that the undead created by lesser Nekromants will fail from time to time and wreck havoc at the factories.  It was early quite clear that shortswords and pikes proved ineffective against their undead, whereas a hammerblow to the head works equally well on longdead, soulless or living opponent.  However, in time it appears as if the original Hammerers thought their hammers to be crude as they were often mistaken for smith apprentices.  Looking for something more dignified, they worked with some local smiths, who definitely did not want to be mistaken for the crude Hobmark Hammerers, to produce a hammer that both could strike through the skulls of the undead and an enemies platemail while looking stylish.  After a few hundred hammers had been delivered some hog riders noticed that the hammers looked quite a bit like the louse flinging tools they use in their games with the notorious hog louse.  The hammers were then called Louse Hammers.  If one asks a Hammerer the answer would instead be that the hammers are the trademark of Luzern's Fine Metal Wares which gives it its name, but as they are pretentious and snobby, it is obvious that the former origin of the name rings closer to the truth.  The Hammerers are still required to carry a small hammer as it has also been noted in the fielded armies that a soulless that has lost a limb can be easily if somewhat temporarily fixed with a hammer and a nail."

selectmonster "Hobmark Pikeneer"
descr "Living in the marshy backwaters of the Hoburg state, the role of the Pikeneers has been questioned, as few horses would trek into those swamps.  Some sharp tongues in the Hoburg Gazette have claimed that they can only be considered an aggressive threat against the Hoburg Knights, but this claim has been vehemently denied by the Markgraf in a campaign involving colorful ads and free mince pies at the town square in the major towns."

selectmonster "Markgraf Guard"
descr "Due to a desire to appear quite as successful as his more prosperous cousins, the Markgraf has chosen to more or less copy the trappings of the office of the Burgmeister, including his own bodyguard.  Mainly deployed to man the walls or to guard the Markgraf, the guard is specialized in countering throngs of angered peasants, and they are famed for their ability to form living chains before the Markgraf, and for being able to find hidden food larders during the Markgraf's impromptu tax rounds."

selectmonster "Hog Hussar"
descr "For the travelers who have had the opportunity to observe both Hoburg and Hobmark troops, the Markgraf's units often appear as bleak copies of the Hoburg troops.  However, there is a difference when it comes down to the Hoburg Hussars.  The original Markgraf, being a pig farmer himself, went into painstaking efforts to set up his own elite of hog riders.  The Hog Hussars are more lightly armored than the Hog Knights, sporting only a light cuirass and favoring a Hobmark sabre, making them deadly as they circle the enemy footsoldiers."

selectmonster "Markmeister"
descr "Leader of the Hog Hussars and pig herder extraordinaire, the Markmeisters are not chosen due to their excellence in battle but rather their loyalty, their inability to question orders and their closeness to the hogs their groups ride.  There are some who argue that the Markmeisters are nothing more than enthralled Hussars, but this has been fervently denied by both the Markgraf and the Hussars.  The Markmeisters themselves usually do not respond to that, or any other question."

selectmonster "Little Longdead"
descr "According to necromantic economic theory, Longdead are by far the most the most advantageous form of undead.  Though more brittle than the Soulless, the resources required for making them are almost endless.  Nekromants and Necromancers alike are experimenting with fusing parts of different types of Longdead together so that they need not originate from the same corpse.  However, while the Necromancers aim to salvage parts after a battle, the Nekromants are instead working on making an ‚Äúautochurning Esmeralda‚Äù by fusing several undead together.  So far their abominations have mainly managed to churn a handful of Nekromant Apprentices to death before falling apart."

selectmonster "Little Soulless"
descr "While being one of the basic units in the undead army, the Soulless were also the original workers in the necromantic manufacturies of the Markgraf.  Though slow and sluggish, they worked both day and night, thus earning good money for their proprietor.  Among the first batches it was noted however, that the undead Hoburgher would still stop for second or third breakfasts even without needing to eat more than the occasional brain."

selectmonster "Little Ghoul"
descr "During experiments with Soulless workers and in an attempt at giving them more independence, a somewhat stronger and more durable breed was discovered.  The problem was however, that the insatiable hunger of the Hoburghers did not cease, but would often be directed towards the nearest living creature.  From a necro-economic point of view, this was a breakthrough, as the saliva of the Little Ghoul was viral and would create a new, if chewed upon, Little Ghoul of the person so bitten.  Considering the rather small population in the Markgraf's domains, there would soon be a problem with getting enough fresh corpses, though this was solved in a rather Hoburg manner.  All citizens of the Hobmark are offered a contract that will give a certain amount of money for the use of their body after death.  After the nature of the Ghouls became known, most of the citizens so contracted have demanded to become ghouls after their death in order to not lose their ability to eat."

selectmonster "Ghoul Baron"
descr "According to a certain ill-reputed doctor, the art of reviving someone is dependent on two factors ‚Äì memory and hunger. At times a revived corpse will only retain its memory but no willpower in which case it becomes a ghost, none of its previous hungers drives it on and it is just a lingering.  In the opposite case it is just the hunger driving it.  As is easily understood it is difficult to revive a hoburg and have the resulting corpse not being overwhelmed by hunger.  The easiest way to let the subject of the revivification retain some memories would be to start the reanimation process just a few minutes before the subject dies.  As such it is not a popular procedure, but lured by the promise of eternal life and eternal dinners, some of the markgrafs let themselves be talked into this by the nekromants."

selectmonster "Ghoulgraf"
descr "Some of the revivified Markgrafs appear stronger and just as much in control as when they were alive.  Though it is generally assumed that the Nekromant control the revived Markgraf, some observations seems to contradict that notion.  It is possible that certain strong souls will continue to amass memories even after death."

selectmonster "Ghoul Guardian"
descr "In the contract between the markgraf guardians and the Markgraf, a small clause can be read that they should serve the Graf beyond the point of death, both his or theirs.  Though some of the guardians do follow their ward in to the everlasting embrace of undeadness, most are not so willing to serve.  Due to the clause, and the almost sacred nature of business-contracts between Hoburgs, they are bound to follow them.  The unwillingness to actually die turns them into more vicious and less aware creatures.  As they almost act on instinct one has to beware of his bodyguards whenever one is in a meeting with the Ghoul Baron."
