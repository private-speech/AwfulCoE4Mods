# Note: currently this race lacks weapon modding due to the limit on modded weapons being reached. I've changed the name of the module to be loaded last alphabetically and as such weapons found in the other mods can be used. If the mods are not loaded alphabetically then weapons may be missing on units.

# Firing hefty proximity-shells filled with super-dense tectorium ore, the tremor cannon gouges huge craters out of the battlefield with every shot. Even as a lethal wave of blazing overpressure rolls out from the blast, the tectorium’s primary reaction shudders out through the ground, shaking the battlefield to its bedrock and flinging the enemy off their feet in screaming confusion

descr "Requisitions one of the many heavy support vehicles. Each is equipped with powerful long-range weaponry, able to decimate entire armies if given sufficient support. A battery of Hydras can clear the air, a battery of Wyverns with stormshard mortars can reduce infantry to paste while a battery of Basilisks can shake the very earth with devastating bombardments at extreme range. The specialist missiles carried by Manticores and Deathstrikes can obliterate almost any target - but are much too precious to waste on all but the most important of sieges."

# Character, Preferred Enemy (Orks), Senior Officer, Summary Execution, Voice of Command.
# Iron Will: If Yarrick loses his last Wound, place him on his side instead of removing him. At the start of your next turn, roll a D6. On a 3+ he regains a single Wound – place Yarrick as close to his previous position as possible whilst remaining more than 1" from any enemy models or impassable terrain. On a 1 or 2, Yarrick is removed as a casualty.
# Bale Eye: The Orks of Armageddon believed that Old Man Yarrick could kill with but a glance, a superstition
# that the Commissar was keen to exploit to his advantage. The forbidding bale eye implanted in place of his
# own can project a powerful short-range blast of laser energy that will core out an opponent’s skull at ten
# paces.
# The Bale Eye can be used in the Shooting phase in addition to firing another weapon.
# Range - 6"
# S - 3
# AP - 3
# Type - Pistol
# Power Field: Yarrick is protected by a thrumming power field, a potent personal shield generator that
# bleeds the force from incoming attacks amid crackling skeins of golden lightning until it stops them altogether.
# The Power Field gives Yarrick a 4+ invulnerable save.

spr2 "w40kmod/astra_militarum_commissar_yarrick1.tga"
descr "Commissar Yarrick is a peerless Imperial hero. During the Second War for Armageddon, Yarrick rallied the defenders of Hades Hive against the Ork hordes of Warlord Ghazghkull Thraka when the city’s fall seemed inevitable. Yarrick’s courage and tenacity were an inspiration to his followers, carrying them through hardships untold to eventual victory despite a terrible cost in lives. ^^Yarrick’s body is a patchwork of scars and bionics, yet the old Commissar fights on unbowed. In combat with the hulking Warboss Ugulhard during the final battle for Hades Hive, Yarrick lost an arm. He took the Ork’s head in return, replacing his severed limb with Ugulhard’s own power klaw. When he lost an eye in a vicious fire fight, Yarrick ensured it was replaced with a powerful laser-bionic, playing to the Ork fear of his supposed ‘evil eye’. Without the tireless efforts of Commissar Yarrick, Armageddon and its surrounding systems would surely have been lost to Ghazghkull’s hordes, and his crusade to finally slay ‘the Beast of Armageddon’ continues to this day."

Of those allowed to live, a tiny fraction are judged strong enough to undergo training and go on to serve the Imperium in a staggering array of capacities as a Sanctioned Psyker, from Inquisitor to Imperial Guard Battle Psyker. The Warp influences communication between worlds spanning the Imperium and between vessels travelling between these worlds. This is the domain of the Astropaths, who stretch their minds deep into the Immaterium to connect with the psychic resonance of their own kind throughout the Imperium to pass information, messages, or warnings in an instant. Decades of training and the torment of the Soul Binding ritual strengthen the will of these psykers to withstand penetrating the terrors of the Warp. ^^Astropaths may unsettle their comrades with their hollow, eyeless gaze and the susurrus of telepathic murmurs that fogs the air around them. Yet their ability to project their thoughts, or to influence the thoughts of others, can make them a potent weapon on the battlefield.   ^^“Blindness may be the price I pay for the God-Emperor’s sacred touch, but I see more than you can possibly imagine. I see worlds rolling countless and wondrous beyond, I see colours and sights that would burn your mind to ciders by their merest glimpse. I see...Them, lurking in the spaces between realities, their claws ever scratching to get in, ever wanting. No, it is you who are truly blind, ignorant and imperilled as a helpless child in the blackest night with ravening wolves all around. For they are here, right now around us and you cannot see. In the dark, in the light it matters not... for they see you and they hunger.” ^———Astropath Plenipotentiary Aldus Col"

descr "A Master of Ordnance is the specialist within many Imperial Guard regiments who is responsible for calling in timely and accurate artillery fire to support the action of his unit and any others further down the chain of command. Unlike many of the other specialist roles that Guardsmen can fill over the course of their service, the position of Master of Ordnance is a highly formalised position within most regiments. While some regiments allow any officer equipped with a Vox link or accompanied by a Vox operator to request artillery fire, the Master of Ordnance has the command authority to order such bombardments, which can light the field ablaze, shatter defensive lines, or cripple a charging wave of foes before they can strike.  ^^The role of the Master of Ordnance is an unusual one in that unlike many others, it relies on the individual interacting with units outside of his own regiment on a regular basis. After all, most Imperial Guard regiments consist almost entirely of the same general type of sub-units. If an infantry regiment requires artillery support it must obtain it from an artillery regiment, which itself may be positioned many miles behind the front lines. Communication between regiments can be very difficult, and facilitating this communication is the role of the Master of Ordnance.  ^^Given that many Imperial Guard regiments speak dialects of Low Gothic that are all but unintelligible to others, the scope for confusion is enormous. The Master of Ordnance is therefore trained to communicate rapidly and clearly regarding abstract concepts such as trajectory, yields, vectors, and the like, and can thus converse in the common language of high explosives. In addition to the necessity to converse with other regiments, the Master of Ordnance might also be required to coordinate with members of the Imperial Navy as vessels in low orbit offer super heavy fire support to the “ground pounders” or with the servants of the Adeptus Mechanicus, the custodians of all manner of arcane war machines from mighty Titans to arrays of exotic city-razing archeotech weaponry. ^^“I know those coordinates are only forty metres from my position and I sincerely thank you for your concern, but the enemy is closer - bring it down now, all of it!” ^———Trooper Vandell, 34th Cadian"

descr "Lord Castellan Ursarkar E. Creed was found, an orphan child, in the war-torn ruins of Kasr Gallan. Clutching a service pistol and a tattered copy of ‘De Gloria Macharius’, this hard eyed boy was adopted by the Guardsmen of the Cadian 8th who had found him. From a young age, Creed excelled as both soldier and tactician, rising swiftly through the Cadian Whiteshields to earn a command of his own. This stocky and intense young warrior possessed an intuitive grasp of strategy and was a natural leader. From squad-level decisions to exercises with vast regiments of military might, Creed displayed a genius that some whispered echoed that of Macharius himself. Blistering assaults, devious traps and impenetrable defences were Creed’s trademarks, and within three decades the ragged orphan boy had earned acclaim as Cadia’s greatest living commander. Only the strict structure of rank and privilege that governs the militarised society of Cadia now held Creed’s meteoric career in check. ^^This was to change when an insidious Chaos plot saw the Cadian Governor Primus treacherously slain. Into the vacuum stepped Creed, who in the wake of his valiant counteroffensive at Tyrok Fields was publicly named Lord Castellan and Commander-in-Chief of the Cadian Military. The Lord Castellan rose immediately to this new challenge, beginning his tireless work to strengthen the defences of the Cadian Gate. His efforts came not a moment too soon, for the hour has grown late and deadly foes stir once more within the Eye of Terror. ^^Wherever Creed goes, so too walks the bullish figure of Colour Sergeant Jarran Kell. Friends for decades, Kell would gladly give his life to preserve that of his oldest comrade. His vox-amplified voice rolls along the Imperial lines, ensuring the Lord Castellan’s orders are followed to the letter."

descr "Colonel ‘Iron Hand’ Straken is Catachan’s most notorious and storied commanding officer. A veteran of decades of constant warfare, Straken has fought at the forefront of more battles and survived more wounds than most Imperial Guardsmen have eaten hot meals. Irascible and gutsy in the extreme, Colonel Straken leads from the front with a vigour that belies his years. Having worked his way up from footslogging grunt to colonel of the entire Catachan II ‘Green Vipers’, Straken continues to share every hardship of the common soldier. Larger than life and twice as violent, Straken can always be found where the fighting is thickest. Bellowing a constant stream of orders and invective, the Colonel stands shoulder to shoulder with his fellow Catachans. Straken’s lack of tolerance for any display of incompetence or cowardice is legendary, and his men redouble their efforts in their determination to live up to Straken’s exacting standards. ^^Straken’s high personal standards and ethic of ‘getting stuck in’ are matched by a determination never to waste good Catachan lives for ephemeral gains. The Colonel has nothing but scorn for officers who fritter away lives to further their own careers. This fact has caused endless friction with the commanders of other regiments, yet Straken displays the same contempt for upper-echelon politics as he does for the foe. Straken’s men all but deify their gung-ho commander, and have carried his battered body to safety almost as often as he has dragged theirs. ^^Regardless of the top brass’ opinion, none can argue with Straken’s breathtaking service record. Fighting initially under his mentor, the infamous Colonel Greiss, Straken has distinguished himself at the Battle of Moden’s Ridge, the Dulma’lin Cleansing, the Ulani Aftermath and the evacuation of Vartol City to name but a few. On Ulani IV Straken dragged a wounded comrade to safety across half a continent. On Vendal’s Landing he repulsed a phalanx of Daemon Engines with only twenty-two men, ten lasguns and a case of short-fused mining charges. At the battle of the Red Rain Straken personally defeated the notorious Dark Eldar Archon Yrekh Drash in single combat, crushing the degenerate xenos’ head in his whirring bionic fist. ^^During his years of service the Colonel has suffered dozens of wounds in the line of duty, amongst the most serious being the arm he lost to a Miral land shark. This and a plethora of other grave injuries should, by rights, have killed the indomitable Catachan several times over. Straken, however, fights on with undiminished determination, his ravaged body riddled with an ever increasing number of gleaming bionics, and his orders punctuated by yells of ‘Do I have to do everything myself?!’. ^^“‘Medic! Stop whining, Brook, you’ve got another damned leg!’” ^———Colonel 'Iron Hand' Straken, Battle of Moden's Ridge"

descr "Nork Deddog is an Ogryn bodyguard of legendary repute. Upon his recruitment into the Imperial Guard, Nork quickly displayed an uncommon level of mental aptitude. The surprisingly developed abhuman could sign his own name, count to four, and even speak in short sentences. It was not long before Nork was assigned to special duties as a regimental lifeguard for Colonel Greiss of the Catachan II. ^^When the regiment was committed to the ongoing war on Balor, it was soon apparent that Nork had found his sizeable niche. While Greiss was as vocally warlike as any good Catachan officer should be, he was old and physically frail. The men of the regiment soon became used to the old Colonel bellowing orders from the shelter of Nork’s massive frame, the Ogryn’s ripper gun mowing down the foe with shredding bursts as shots rebounded harmlessly from his bulky armour. After the disaster at Hill Gamma Zero, Deddog’s reputation was cemented when he carried the badly wounded Greiss to safety through hostile territory, dragging the wreckage of the Colonel’s Chimera behind him for cover the entire way. ^^Since that bloody conflict, Nork’s skills as a bodyguard have been in great demand. His loyalty is beyond question, and the hulking Ogryn would rather sustain terrible wounds than permit a single scratch upon his master. When Orks overran the command dugout at the battle of Chabda Bridge, Nork was the only one to stand his ground beside Sub-overlord Ven Vambold. During the ensuing brawl, Deddog bullied his way into the Orks’ midst and subjected the xenos Warboss to a headbutt so ferocious that the monstrous Ork was hurled from the dugout to its death in the sizzling acid of the Chabda River far below. ^^Nork has saved the lives of well over one hundred officers, earning himself a chest-full of medals in the process. Dozens of war zones that would have descended into anarchy have instead seen the banners of Imperial victory raised high thanks to Nork’s constant, selfless heroism. During the brief periods of peace between deployments, Nork experiences chronic discomfort whenever compelled to accompany his latest master to a social function or parade drill. However, such embarrassments only encourage Nork to fight all the harder when he returns to the field of battle, determined to prove his worth and bask in the satisfying glow of being the Imperial Guard’s finest bodyguard."

# "A Tank Commander rides to battle in the cupola of a mighty Leman Russ battle tank. These grizzled men are virtually one with their machine, possessing an implicit knowledge of armoured warfare in all its forms. Granted their pick of the armoured fighting vehicles available to their regiment, they are further entitled to pick their crew from the finest veterans. The average Tank Commander is therefore a steely eyed ace, heading up a crew of the very best their regiment has to offer. ^^A Tank Commander will always be found leading a squadron of Leman Russ battle tanks, their coolly delivered orders greatly augmenting the effectiveness of their squadmates. Whether directing deadly salvoes into onrushing xenos or clashing with collossal enemy war machines, the Tank Commander and his squadron have few equals. However, for all their armoured might, it is a Tank Commander’s fusion of combat experience and bellicose leadership that makes them especially deadly. ^^These veteran armour commanders will often be assigned temporary leadership of infantry or artillery assets. This may see the Tank Commander’s’ squadron line-breaking at the head of an overwhelming infantry offensive, or digging in to provide close cover for thundering batteries of big guns. Whatever the case, the Tank Commander’s strategic cunning and deadly armoured steed can anchor an entire battle line, or smash that of the foe asunder. Infantrymen may grumble when assigned to the command of a ‘tread-head’, mistrusting such a man’s grasp of the hardships faced by honest footsloggers, yet such complaints soon turn to cheers when the commander’s tank squadron rolls into the foe’s ranks, all guns blazing and tracks churning enemy bodies to bloody paste."

# Knight Commander Pask is Cadian’s best-known tank ace, and his grizzled visage has graced propaganda bills across the Cadian Gate for decades. Yet it is on the field of battle, amid the fires of war and the snarl of engines, that Pask is truly at home. Possessing an instinctive nous for armoured combat on any scale, Pask claims to feel the tank he commands as an extension of his own body, and has left the wreckage of foes uncounted blazing in his wake. ^^The Knight Commander began his rise to fame as gunnery seneschal aboard the Leman Russ Hand of Steel, serving as part of the Cadian 423rd armoured regiment. Deployed onto the planet Cyris, the regiment formed part of a battle group tasked with halting the relentless advance of Waaagh! Gutcutta. At the battle of Genna’s Rift the 423rd found themselves directly in the path of Gutcutta’s final, massive armoured push. As the two lines of war machines crashed together, a lumbering Ork Battle Fortress ground its way over the Hand of Steel, crushing the tank’s turret and commanding officer in the process. ^^Swiftly taking command of the battered vehicle, Pask had the driver swing around and, drawing a bead on the Ork war engine still grinding through the Cadian lines, executed it with a single pinpoint blast of lascannon fire. The Battle Fortress went up like the Saint Vanus Day fireworks and, as its flaming wreckage rained from the sky, Pask went on to rally the Cadian counter-attack, claiming a further fourteen confirmed armour-kills before the battle’s end. ^^On the planet of Haytor’s Hole, the Hand of Steel was wrecked by the last survivor of a squadron of Eldar Fire Prisms, though not before Pask’s Leman Russ had cut its killer in half with its last, dying salvo. Declining the honour of commanding one of his regiment’s mighty Baneblades, Pask instead chose to demonstrate his solidarity with the tankers of the 423rd. Claiming another Leman Russ as his new steed, Pask renamed her the Hand of Steel. ^^This ritual has been repeated on a dozen occasions in the decades since. Whether felling heretic Titans on Saint Cyllia’s World or battling bio-titans amongst the Tyranid swarms in the Batran Traverse, it is a brave or foolish foe indeed that strays into the gun sights of Knight Commander Pask and his Hand of Steel. ^^“The Victor lives in honour; the Vanquished dies in shame.” ^———Departmento Munitorium Strategic Parables 27:2"

A Lord Commissar is as likely to lead a heroic raid against a key location as he is to order motivational bombardments by batteries of artillery upon fleeing Imperial Guard forces. After all, in dark days such as these, true heroism rarely stems from kind acts."

descr "Every Imperial citizen recognises the distinctive cap and greatcoat of the Commissar, whether from hab-block propaganda frescoes or grainy Munitorum recruitment picts. To the masses of humanity, these men are symbols of Imperial authority whose sole remit is to ensure that all do their duty in the Emperor’s name. Yet the truth of these high-ranking officers is rather more complex. ^^Commissars are recruited from amongst the students of the widespread Schola Progenium. While the majority of the Schola’s wards go on to become Adepts or join the Militarum Tempestus, only the best of the best will be recommended for service in the Officio Prefectus. Inductees must have absolute faith in the Imperium. They must display the proper levels of sincere totalitarian idealism. They must be able to fight as well as any hive-spire duellist while fulfilling the conflicting roles of merciless taskmaster and inspiring hero with equal ease. It is further the duty of a Commissar to learn the culture and customs of the regiment to which he is attached. He must command equal respect whether assigned to dutiful Vostroyans or hard-bitten, insular Catachans. Should discipline or morale falter, it is the task of the Commissar to take whatever steps necessary to restore order, and to do so in the absolute knowledge that his actions are just. Under the steely gaze of such a man, Imperial Guardsmen must be inspired to deeds they never believed possible. In extremis, a Commissar must be prepared to execute wavering soldiers or incompetent officers without a moment’s remorse; few things enforce discipline better than a malcontent or coward being shot dead for their failings, and this message is all the stronger when a mass-reactive bolt shell sprays a Guardsman’s brains across his horrified comrades in a shower of gore."

spr2 "w40kmod/astra_militarum_ministorum_priest1.tga"
descr "Every regiment of the Imperial Guard is required to have at least one attached Ministorum Priest. These holy men have a crucial role to play within the ranks of the Imperial Guard, providing a religious crutch upon which the common soldiery can lean. Whether by taking the dignified confessional of an officer forced to send waves of men to their deaths, or leading rousing regimental prayers, Ministorum Priests provide this essential support. ^^Ever ready to martyr themselves upon the altar of Imperial victory, Priests will stride willingly into the fires of war. Yet it is for their effect upon their comrades that Imperial Commanders value Priests most highly. Their fiery oratory and bellicose war hymns can steady a battle line in the face of overwhelming odds or drive their flock into an impassioned frenzy in which men shrug off mortal wounds and fight with a passion bordering on madness. Many Imperial Guardsmen speak of seeing seraphs soaring on the hot winds of war, called to battle by the exhortations of Ministorum Priests. Whether these miraculous phenomena can be attributed to mass hysteria or the manifest powers of the Emperor matters little – countless battles have been won by Imperial Guardsmen in the grip of religious fervour."

descr "Converts the terrain into that of an Imperial Statue. ^^The history of the Imperium is replete with heroic warriors – individuals whose noble deeds and sacrifice on the battlefield are the stuff of legends. Though the names of the vast majority are forgotten to the careless passage of time, occasionally a hero has arisen above obscurity to become idolised by the Imperium’s populace.

Whilst typically equipped to provide anti-aircraft support, some instead sport a range of heavy gatling guns and battle cannons to guard against more typical attacks. In either case, Firestorm Redoubts are usually constructed at regular intervals along Wall of Martyrs Imperial Defence Lines, providing an interlinking curtain of firepower that is next to impossible for enemy forces to get past."

descr "Enginseers are highly trained members of the Cult Mechanicus and are dedicated to the maintenance of Imperial technology. Through many years of study they have gained the knowledge of the rituals and litanies that form the body of machine lore, as well as a deep understanding of the more practical disciplines of mechanics and electronics. In this role they serve across the galaxy, often in harm's way, as they will be called on to make repairs on the battlefield as well as in the workshop. They are a common sight on battlefields with large numbers of armoured vehicles, and are often accompanied by a retinue of servitors for assistance or protection. Although most Guardsmen revere their vehicles enough not to risk annoying an Enginseer by 'tinkering,' the modification of vehicles to fulfill a certain need is inevitable, much to the chagrin of any Enginseers present. Enginseer contingents are also included in the mighty Titan Legions and the crews of the massive warships of the Imperial Navy, allowing them to perform emergency repairs in the heat of battle. ^^Despite the respect they usually command among the units they are seconded to, Enginseers are not held in high regard among the Cult Mechanicus itself as their skills seldom contribute to The Quest for Knowledge. As a result of their overwhelmingly practical knowledge, they are often viewed as lowly but necessary cogs in the workings of the Cult. Enginseers make use of robotic arm augmentations known as Mechadendrites that are connected to their central nervous system via the spine. They are used to help the enginseer in repair operations, heavy lifting and for self defence. ^^“Oh great Machine God, we beseech thee to deliver us from danger. ^Oh great Machine God, we beseech thee to invest this metal carcass with your spirit. ^Oh great machine God, we beseech thee to bring life to the inanimate. ^Oh great Machine God, we beech thee to summon forth the holy en-Djinn” ^———Tech-Priest Muarex. ^Spoken in the midst of a raging fire -before- pushing a button to turn on the fire extinguishing pumps."

descr "Conscripts represent hastily conscripted men, raised from surrounding planets in dire situations. In times of great emergency, the Departmento Munitorum will demand local Governors raise vast quantities of troops for immediate action. Such measures can see entire cities or continents all but emptied and its citizens sent off to fight. ^^Whiteshield cadets and otherwise ill-trained troops, often too young or old for normal conscription, are inducted into the Imperial Guard and rushed through basic training. They form squads massed together as a single platoon. The concentrated firepower of a large platoon tends to outweigh the relative lack of combat ability of the individual conscripts. ^^By the age of sixteen all Cadians are adept in endurance training, weapons handling, hand-to-hand combat, and vehicular and chemical warfare drills, and are raring to prove themselves in Cadia’s youth army. These so-called Whiteshields are comparable to the conscripts of many worlds, recognisable by the thick white stripe that runs front to back on their helms. ^^Whiteshield battalions are not carelessly flung into battle by Cadian high command, yet neither are they afforded any special consideration. Expected to fight as frontline troops alongside their older and more experienced comrades, perhaps half of all Whiteshield inductees survive to claim their rank as a fully fledged Imperial Guardsman. ^^After two year of battle, surviving Whiteshields are officially promoted to the rank of Shock Trooper."

descr "The Cadian Shock Troops are believed by many to be without equal in the entirety of the Imperial Guard. Displaying enviable levels of discipline, excellent marksmanship, and a cynical gallows humour, Cadian soldiers hold true to the tenet that to do your best and give your life for the Emperor is the highest form of honour. The Shock Troops are armed and equipped to extremely high standards, and the constant warfare experienced by these regiments results in a high proportion of grizzled Veterans and skilled officers. It is impossible to list the encyclopedia of worlds and warzones that have known the glorious victories of the Cadian Shock Troops; for ten millennia the Cadians have hammered out a reputation unparalleled in all of human history. ^^Across the length and breadth of the Imperium, the soldiers of Cadia are embroiled in countless bloody wars. The Shock Troops are in constant demand, for a single Cadian regiment is said to be worth ten such formations of lesser men. For thousands of years, these grim, courageous people have done their duty with uncompromising nobility and determination. Yet now, as Abaddon’s thirteenth Black Crusade batters the Cadian Gate, Cadian officers galaxy wide are requesting redeployment to defend their homeworld. Stories proliferate, brought by newly founded Cadian regiments, that their world burns with the fires of war. Wave after wave of traitor forces ploughs into Cadian space, striking mercilessly at the fortress world and her sister planets despite all Imperial efforts to deny them. What loyal Cadian – and there are few indeed who are anything but – could resist the call to defend the proud world of their birth? Yet it is a testament to the sheer discipline and piety of these soldiers that, whether permitted to defend their home or not, Cadian regiments across the galaxy fight on regardless. Indeed, the fires of their deadly determination are only stoked higher by the war that even now engulfs their planet."

descr "Conscripts represent hastily conscripted men, raised from surrounding planets in dire situations. In times of great emergency, the Departmento Munitorum will demand local Governors raise vast quantities of troops for immediate action. Such measures can see entire cities or continents all but emptied and its citizens sent off to fight. ^^Whiteshield cadets and otherwise ill-trained troops, often too young or old for normal conscription, are inducted into the Imperial Guard and rushed through basic training. They form squads massed together as a single platoon. The concentrated firepower of a large platoon tends to outweigh the relative lack of combat ability of the individual conscripts. ^^By the age of sixteen all Cadians are adept in endurance training, weapons handling, hand-to-hand combat, and vehicular and chemical warfare drills, and are raring to prove themselves in Cadia’s youth army. These so-called Whiteshields are comparable to the conscripts of many worlds, recognisable by the thick white stripe that runs front to back on their helms. ^^Whiteshield battalions are not carelessly flung into battle by Cadian high command, yet neither are they afforded any special consideration. Expected to fight as frontline troops alongside their older and more experienced comrades, perhaps half of all Whiteshield inductees survive to claim their rank as a fully fledged Imperial Guardsman. ^^After two year of battle, surviving Whiteshields are officially promoted to the rank of Shock Trooper."

spr1 "w40kmod/astra_militarum_catachan_commander1.tga"
spr2 "w40kmod/astra_militarum_catachan_commander1.tga"
descr "Catachan is one of the most notorious death worlds in the Imperium, and its planet-wide jungles are lethal beyond reason. Yet despite the exceptionally perilous nature of the Catachan ecosystem, the servants of the Emperor inhabit this vast world in surprising numbers. Thanks to the brutal environment in which they are raised, Catachans are physically and mentally resilient on a level that much of Humanity simply cannot match. Cunning, resourceful and uncompromising, Catachans must be born survivors simply to reach adulthood. It speaks volumes of the Catachans that they maintain a population capable not only of fighting their own battle for survival, but of sending forces to fight the wider wars of the Imperium as well. ^^Catachan troopers take pride in the fact that their leaders suffer through every hardship alongside them. Catachan officers enjoy no special privileges, and are often renowned amongst their subordinates for having personally saved the lives of half the men in their company. Rather than treat their men as servile underlings, Catachan officers command with crude banter that conceals an underlying mutual respect. Though inarguably effective within Catachan ranks, this style of leadership makes the job of outsiders such as Commissars doubly difficult and often extremely dangerous when they are attached to Catachan. ^^For all their faults, the men of Catachan excel in close quarter, fast-paced fire fights. The Jungle Fighters excel when deployed into unusually hazardous warzones, whether these be spore-choked arboreal hells or the tangled duct networks of rebellious underhives. ^^Catachans possess natural survival instincts and approach peril as another man might relish sitting down to a good meal. This predilection toward danger is expressed in the Catachans’ chosen weapons of war: flamers and demo-charges that force them to close with the foe. The Jungle Fighters claim they can only make sure of the kill by looking their enemy square in the eye. This ruthless diligence is epitomised in Catachan’s exceptional snipers, who endure unspeakable hardships to get the perfect shot at the perfect moment. A popular pearl of wisdom amongst Catachans is ‘if you want it done right, send a Jungle Fighter.’"

descr "Catachan is one of the most notorious death worlds in the Imperium, and its planet-wide jungles are lethal beyond reason. Yet despite the exceptionally perilous nature of the Catachan ecosystem, the servants of the Emperor inhabit this vast world in surprising numbers. Thanks to the brutal environment in which they are raised, Catachans are physically and mentally resilient on a level that much of Humanity simply cannot match. Cunning, resourceful and uncompromising, Catachans must be born survivors simply to reach adulthood. It speaks volumes of the Catachans that they maintain a population capable not only of fighting their own battle for survival, but of sending forces to fight the wider wars of the Imperium as well. ^^For all their faults, the men of Catachan excel in close quarter, fast-paced fire fights. The Jungle Fighters excel when deployed into unusually hazardous warzones, whether these be spore-choked arboreal hells or the tangled duct networks of rebellious underhives. ^^Catachans possess natural survival instincts and approach peril as another man might relish sitting down to a good meal. This predilection toward danger is expressed in the Catachans’ chosen weapons of war: flamers and demo-charges that force them to close with the foe. The Jungle Fighters claim they can only make sure of the kill by looking their enemy square in the eye. This ruthless diligence is epitomised in Catachan’s exceptional snipers, who endure unspeakable hardships to get the perfect shot at the perfect moment. A popular pearl of wisdom amongst Catachans is ‘if you want it done right, send a Jungle Fighter.’"

descr "In the war torn universe of the 41st Millennium, law and order is difficult to maintain. Across a million worlds it is barely held by the very fingers of those who uphold the Emperor's law. The Adeptus Arbites are the pillars of justice across the galaxy and patrol the far flung planets of the Imperium, where rebellion and defiance are crimes against humanity and the Abitrators hunt down and capture rebels who would bring suffering and chaos to all Mankind. The toughest criminals captured by the Arbitrators are inducted into the ranks of the Penal Legions. The Penal Legion is made up from the scum and undevout men of the galaxy -- mass murderers, rebellious Planetary Defence Force troopers, thieves, hijackers and all other manner of criminals are made part of the Penal Legion for their sins. These lawbreakers are saved from sentences such as termination or slavery and instead taken to battle against the Emperor's foes. ^^There are a few in the Emperor's own army, the Imperial Guard, who do not respect the Emperor, that are disloyal and rebellious. These soldiers are the criminals of war, men who would sooner run in the face of an adversary than defeat it and those who would disobey their commanders to save themselves while leaving others to pay for their folly. Becoming a Penal Legionnaire for a member of the Imperial Guard requires being condemned for a crime that is punishable by death and taking the choice to meet that death by surviving in a Penal Legion. It means a decision to meet the death at the hands of the enemies of mankind rather than at the hands of the firing squad or Commissar's bolt pistol. Sometimes a Penal Legionary is a rare individual plucked from the ranks of the condemned to serve the Inquisition. ^^“It is with your toil and your labour that ye shall be redeemed. Through bloodshed ye shall know absolution! The blood that shall be shed shall be both that of your enemies and your own.” ^———Isaiah, Praecentor of the 289th Orcan Penal Legion."

descr "Ratlings are a breed of human-descended abhumans who are characteristically short and rotund. They have incredible eyesight and their small size enables them to move stealthily in close terrain which larger troops might have difficulty negotiating. These traits mean they are ideally suited to the role of snipers, and it is in this capacity that they are recruited into the Imperial Guard. ^^Though less resilient than their human comrades, Ratlings are naturally excellent shots. It is said that Ratling marksmen can take the head off a heretic from over a kilometre away. Coupled with their knack for staying out of harm’s way, this makes Ratlings formidable snipers who can take a surprising toll upon superior enemy forces. Inevitably, the abhuman Ratlings face prejudice from the men they serve alongside, yet their skill as thieves, fences and black marketeers tends to win them acceptance. Indeed, Guardsmen who give the Ratlings too much grief will often find themselves mysteriously short of ammunition in the heat of battle, while their diminutive tormentors watch gleefully through telescopic sights. ^^Regardless of their small stature, and their questionable status as sanctioned aberrants, Ratlings have proven invaluable to the Imperium’s armies time and again. On Crastille, during the War of Weeping, a single squad of Ratlings held the narrow bridge over the tumultuous Widowash River for three full days. Six times the Tau attempted to dislodge Manvolio Grand’s Ratling Sharpshooters, and six times they were hurled back by pinpoint fire. Kroot Shapers and Pathfinder Shas’ui tumbled into the river’s surging flow, neat holes blown through eye-sockets and throats. When a pack of Kroot Hounds was loosed across the bridge, the Ratlings put each down with a single shot, the last beast skidding to a halt on its face a good three metres short of Manvolio’s snipers. Eventually, the Tau were forced to commit several Stealth Teams to the fight – against these near-invisible foes, the Ratlings stood little chance. Most of the abhumans were slaughtered before they could flee, but Manvolio and his closest cronies made it back to Imperial lines alive, there to be hailed as heroes for their efforts. ^^“Hit him from here?

# M36 Pattern Lasgun - Produced in a multitude of different styles and patterns, the Lasgun can be found in use on almost every world of the Imperium. The M36 Pattern is one of the most ubiquitous patterns of Lasgun in use by the Imperial Guard, and has long been the standard weapon issued to the troops of the Armageddon Steel Legion regiments. 
# Armageddon Pattern Rebreather - Designed to keep the wearer alive in even the most noxious atmosphere, this rebreather consists of a mask (often shaped like a skull for senior officers) connected by hose to a small air supply. A character wearing an Armageddon Pattern Rebreather is immune to the effects of gases and issues of air quality, and can even survive underwater at limited depths. The air canister lasts for two full hours before requiring replacement. 

# Specials:
# poisonres 100 # Rebreather protects against poison
# water # Rebreather has air supply for 2h underwater
# nametype 4 # Germanic male

# "So toxic are the ash wastes of Armageddon that a man breathing its air freely would feel his lungs begin to melt and rot away. It is for this reason that the Armageddon Steel Legions are heavily protected against toxic and polluted environments. Each Steel Legion soldier wears a protective trenchcoat, gloves, and a visor to keep his exposure to the corrosive atmosphere at a minimum. Possibly the most iconic piece of gear for the Steel Legion is the rebreather unit carried by every trooper. These units are capable of filtering out the worst effects of any airborne poisons and are the primary reason that many Steel Legion Guardsmen have survived doing battle upon the ash wastes. Senior officers have rebreathers that are often shaped into a mask similar to that of a grinning skull. The Guardsmen of the Steel Legion are not the only things protected from venomous environments within these regiments. Throughout the Steel Legions, all vehicles are fully enclosed and possess airtight seals to ward passengers from the foul and acidic atmosphere encountered by convoys traversing the ash wastes. The Steel Legion takes special care to protect their mighty banners, each one hung with trophies of honour and no small amount of Ork kill markers. These banners are coated with highly resistant materials in an attempt to preserve them from the wastelands' acidic decay. ^^Notes on the Armageddon Pattern Rebreather: Designed to keep the wearer alive in even the most noxious atmosphere, this rebreather consists of a mask (often shaped like a skull for senior officers) connected by hose to a small air supply.

# descr "The Tallarn Desert Raiders is the name given to those Imperial Guard regiments raised from the Desert World of Tallarn who are highly skilled at desert and mobile armoured warfare. The Desert Raiders are mobile guerrilla fighters, evasive and opportunistic. They are especially known for their lightning-quick Sentinel and hard-hitting tank squadrons and are masters of hit-and-run mobile warfare. They love to strike a killing blow at the heart of an enemy formation before returning to their own lines, prepared to pounce once more. The people of Tallarn are extremely resourceful and pragmatic. They are patient, determined and utterly ferocious in pursuit of their enemies. Tallarn are all accomplished riders, and often will use riding mounts to move from battle to battle, dismounting only when they are close to the enemy and wish to employ stealth. Once the enemy is sighted, the Tallarn will stalk them closely, relying on their practiced marksmanship and lightning-quick curved combat knives to achieve victory.^^“Be swift and silent -- as the breeze that crosses the dunes without stirring a grain of sand.” ^———Captain Al'rahem"

# descr "The Vostroyan Firstborn is the name given to the regiments of the Imperial Guard that originate from the industrial Hive World of Vostroya located near the Halo Stars in the Segmentum Obscurus. The Vostroyan regiments have served the Emperor for countless centuries, though in truth they fight to absolve themselves of a terrible shame incurred by their ancestors over ten millennia ago when, during the dark days of the Horus Heresy, Vostroya failed in its duty to the Emperor of Mankind. When the galaxy was consumed in war and anarchy, the Emperor commanded that worlds still loyal to the Imperium send forth fighting men to help defend it against the Warmaster Horus and his Traitor Legions. Vostroya refused, arguing that it could better serve the Imperium by continuing to devote all its efforts to the manufacture of weapons for the Emperor's armies, and that to give up so much of its populace to become warriors for the Imperial Army would render it incapable of producing those weapons in sufficient quantities. The Vostroyans' refusal to provide soldiers was met with uncommon mercy by the Imperium once the Heresy had ended, and the people of Vostroya have forever after sought to atone for their mistake, promising to provide the first-born son of every Vostroyan family to the service of the Imperial Guard. ^^Firstborn regiments are trained in the frozen, snow and ash covered ruins of its ancient cityscapes, on portions of their homeworld no longer habitable or functional, before being shipped out, once each generation, to serve the Imperium, never to return. Unusually, the Firstborn reinforce their regiments, sending new soldiers out to each one, no matter how far away it is. This ensures that the youngest Firstborn have the experience of hardened veterans to draw upon, and means that every Vostroyan Firstborn regiment can trace its existence back to their original mustering, ten thousand standard years before. With every family -- from the highest ruling Techtriarchs of Vostroya to the lowliest menials -- required to send their first-born sons to serve, familial ties within regiments are not uncommon, and many young Vostroyans have found themselves under the guardianship of distant uncles and older cousins, something that encourages a strong bond of brotherhood. Within each regiment, the officer corps is composed of those of noble birth, while the common soldiery are drawn from the worker families that make up the bulk of Vostroya’s population. ^^Vostroyan regiments are most commonly line infantry, and are particularly at home in cold environments and urban areas, as these conditions best match those of their training back on Vostroya. However, Firstborn armoured regiments are not uncommon, turning the Vostroyans’ traditional close ties with the Adeptus Mechanicus to the operation of powerful battle tanks. ^^With both the heavy industrial capacity of Vostroya and its unusual tradition of reinforcement for its existing regiments already in the field, the Vostroyans are particularly well-equipped, clad in durable, plasteel-alloy Carapace Armour unusual for standard Guard regiments and armed with finely-wrought Lasrifles. These are both often passed down through the generations, giving the Firstborn a baroque look, further embellished by their traditional use of red dyes and brass metalwork in their uniforms and wargear."

When the galaxy was consumed in war and anarchy, the Emperor commanded that worlds still loyal to the Imperium send forth fighting men to help defend it against the Warmaster Horus and his Traitor Legions. Vostroya refused, arguing that it could better serve the Imperium by continuing to devote all its efforts to the manufacture of weapons for the Emperor's armies, and that to give up so much of its populace to become warriors for the Imperial Army would render it incapable of producing those weapons in sufficient quantities. The Vostroyans' refusal to provide soldiers was met with uncommon mercy by the Imperium once the Heresy had ended, and the people of Vostroya have forever after sought to atone for their mistake, promising to provide the first-born son of every Vostroyan family to the service of the Imperial Guard. ^^Firstborn regiments are trained in the frozen, snow and ash covered ruins of its ancient cityscapes, on portions of their homeworld no longer habitable or functional, before being shipped out, once each generation, to serve the Imperium, never to return.

These are both often passed down through the generations, giving the Firstborn a baroque look, further embellished by their traditional use of red dyes and brass metalwork in their uniforms and wargear."

descr "Vox-Operators receive specialist training with Guard communications equipment and often acts as an aide or adjutant to an officer. Some Vox-operators are referred to as Comms-Officers and appear to have some level of NCO authority despite being ranked as simple Guardsmen. The Vox-caster is a piece of Imperial technology used by the Imperial Guard to communicate orders over long distances. It is also useful for projecting the leadership of a command unit to the rest of the army, especially if the Vox-caster in the command squad is upgraded to a Master-Vox, although the effects of equipment like standards are not transmitted due to the need to see the standard to gain faith from it. When using the Master-Vox, it allows the commander to send multiple messages to the squads opposed to a normal Vox-caster which can only send one message at a time. ^^The Vostroyan Firstborn is the name given to the regiments of the Imperial Guard that originate from the industrial Hive World of Vostroya located near the Halo Stars in the Segmentum Obscurus.

descr "The Chimera is the most prolific and popular armoured transport used by the Imperial Guard. It is rugged, versatile, and easy to produce in huge numbers. For thousands of years it has been accepted wisdom that the Chimera punches well above its weight in a firefight; the tank itself mounts a variety of punishing anti-personnel weaponry, while passengers can lay down additional fire from its spacious top hatch and flank-mounted lasgun arrays.^^With its slab-like frontal armour the Chimera is well suited to so-called ‘armoured fist’ assaults. Roaring forward through withering fire, the Chimera shields its human cargo long enough to disgorge them directly into forward positions from which they can breach the enemy’s lines. Such squads lend speed and flexibility to the rigid formations of the Imperial Guard, and the impact of such armoured charges has won numerous victories for the Imperium of Man. ^^Over the millennia, the Chimera has been employed in countless war zones, demonstrating its adaptability time and again. High-gain, securely enscriptured vox-arrays allow the Chimera to function as a mobile command bunker. The tank’s amphibious capabilities permit transportation of Guardsmen across supposedly impassable swamps and rivers to strike at unguarded enemy flanks. ^^The strategic value of the Chimera was amply demonstrated during the cleansing of Pelos IV. In the face of an overwhelming traitor offensive along the north bank of the River Fireflow, Catachan General Henk Oberstein mounted three full companies of his finest Jungle Fighters into Chimeras and had them ford the river in a wide flanking manoeuvre. Caught between Oberstein’s heavy weapons emplacements and the shock assault of the armoured spearhead roaring out of the river’s churning waters, the traitors were swiftly and efficiently crushed. ^^It is for these reasons and many more that the Chimera is seen as the faithful workhorse of the Imperial Guard. Equal to almost any strategic challenge from convoy escort to the brutal rigours of the most apocalyptic battles, the Chimera APC is one of the finest weapons in an Imperial Guard Commander’s arsenal, and should never be underestimated."

descr "The Taurox APC is designed to hit hard and fast, exploiting gaps in the enemy battle line or plugging those torn in the Imperium’s. Though lightly armoured, the Taurox packs a punch, mounting twin-linked autocannons to mow down enemy forces as it roars into the breach. Meanwhile, its rugged ‘Castellan’ quad-track unit allows the Taurox to negotiate even the most tangled terrain with ease. ^^The Taurox’s capacity to punch through seemingly impossible terrain makes it an ideal counter-attack asset. Imperial Guard commanders will often hold back squads of short ranged, hard-hitting infantry in Taurox APCs, throwing them in to blunt enemy breakthroughs before they can build momentum. However the Taurox’s ability to traverse rough terrain also finds it regularly employed as a light recon vehicle, or running escort duties on columns of artillery. Here it will swiftly deploy squads of heavy infantry, countering unexpected threats with overwhelming firepower until reinforcements can be brought to bear."

descr "A variant of the Taurox built for use by Militarum Tempestus, the Prime’s design is efficient and flexible. The vehicle’s chassis incorporates arcane technologies that allow it to sustain Tempestus Scions operating in extremely hostile environments, or even the cold vacuum of space. The vehicle can be internally pressurised, and features a suite of life-support systems. Further, its engines can be compelled – using the proper rituals and prayers – to channel magnetic force into the Prime’s tracks. This enables the vehicle to cling to vertical surfaces, and even operate in zero gravity conditions. The Taurox Prime’s weapon load-out is equally versatile – whether blasting enemy infantry apart with hails of missiles and gatling cannon fire, or bringing down tanks and fortifications with their lightweight battle cannons, these vehicles are the ideal transport for the elite forces of the Militarum Tempestus."

# "Ogryns are a crude and exceptionally resilient breed of abhuman hailing from primitive, high gravity worlds. Lacking in intellect, Ogryns compensate for their stupidity with overwhelming physicality – the brutish creatures stand around three metres tall and can shrug off wounds that would kill an Imperial Guardsman several times over. These qualities mean that Ogryns make exceptional shock troops. Anyone that has witnessed an enraged Ogryn tear the head from a Traitor Marine with a single brutal wrench will think twice before questioning the huge abhumans’ value. ^^It is fair to say that Ogryns do have their limitations. Their equipment must be simple and exceptionally rugged, as anything within arm’s reach is likely to see brief and violent service as an improvised club. Their heavily built ripper guns must also be fitted with burst limiters to stop thirty seconds of noisy enjoyment leaving the abhumans without ammunition before battle even begins. Ogryns are easily confused, meaning they work best when given simple, straightforward missions. Their lack of personal hygiene borders on the criminal, making them deeply unpleasant company for common Guardsmen during the long, confined weeks of Warp-travel. However, once indoctrinated into the Imperial creed they are doggedly loyal, and the Ogryns’ strength and resilience make them a potent weapon."
 
# Bullgryns 145pts:
# Bullgryn WS4 BS3 S5 T5 W3 I2 A3 Ld6 Sv4+
# Bullgryn Bone 'ead WS4 BS3 S5 T5 W3 I2 A4 Ld7 Sv4+ 
# Unit Type:
# Infantry. Bullgryn Bone ’ead is Infantry (Character).
# Unit Composition:
# 2 Bullgryns
# 1 Bullgryn Bone ’ead
# Wargear:
# • Carapace armour
# • Grenadier gauntlet
# • Frag grenades
# • Slabshield
# Special Rules:

# • Any model may replace his grenadier gauntlet and slabshield with a power maul and brute shield..........15
# pts/model
# • The squad may take a Chimera or Taurox as a Dedicated Transport.

# "Bullgryns are clad in custom-made carapace armour and carry crude assault weaponry to capitalise on the abhumans’ stature and resilience. While some wield power mauls and buckler-like brute shields, the simple but effective slab shields are their trademark, locking together to form a mobile defence line. So deployed, these units provide their comrades with a wall of walking cover as they advance across the battlefield, soaking up vast volumes of enemy fire in the process. ^^The Ogryns take their protective duties very seriously and will often form a line at the slightest sound of gunfire, which can be most inconvenient in crowded trenches. Yet Guardsmen advancing behind a Bullgryn squad swiftly forget such mishaps as shots whine harmlessly from the Ogryns’ shields, leaving those soldiers crouched in their lee unharmed. Needless to say, casualties are high among the abhumans themselves, but the close range bombardments of the Ogryns’ grenadier gauntlets exact brutal revenge soon enough. The foe are left reeling and shell-shocked even before the maul-wielding Ogryns charge into their midst and bludgeon the survivors to a red paste."

descr "Wyrdvane Psykers transform the howling might of the Warp into a deadly weapon of Imperial supremacy. They are formed from those Scholastica Psykana inductees not able to control their burgeoning powers without guidance and aid. Some have not yet completed the gruelling training to become a Primaris Psyker. Others will never achieve that goal, introverted beyond rescue by the horrors of their own minds. As individuals, such psykers are unpredictable and unsafe. Yet working in concert, these deadly mutants can be a valuable asset.^^Eerily attuned to one another, Wyrdvane Psykers draw strength from communion. A Ministorum choir may entwine voices of varying ability into a strong and harmonious whole. So do squads of Wyrdvanes link their thoughts, the better to slaughter the foes of Mankind. Corposant lightning crackles around the Wyrdvane Psykers as they marshal their powers. Moans and wails spill from their lips, tangled amid stringy ropes of vomited ectoplasm. Armoured battle tanks buckle inwards as the psykers focus their power, crumpling upon their horrified crews like a ration-pack in an Ogryn’s fist. Heretics are incinerated amid billowing clouds of psychic flame, domes of protective telekinetic force enfold quivering Imperial Guardsmen, while pervasive many-voiced whispers talk warriors into madness or horrified self-destruction. ^^Only once a choir of Wyrdvane Psykers have proven their ability to work as a controlled, cohesive whole will they be permitted to take to the field unsupervised. The psykers are formed into potential squads based on the omens of the Emperor’s tarot, and must endure numerous inhumane tests before they are declared battle-ready. They must demonstrate their ability to guard one another’s minds, to stabilise their companions’ more volatile powers and enhance those that flounder or fail. Many will not survive the trials to which they are subjected, and even those that do are still destined to be treated with fear, revulsion and mistrust. Many commanders will leave a Commissar or two in close proximity to a group of Battle Psykers, just to be safe. ^^Insular in the extreme, squads of Wyrdvane Psykers rarely mix with the common troopers – they are only too aware of their comrades’ superstitious disgust, and do what they can to avoid antagonising them. Yet for all this, Wyrdvane Psykers are loyal and dedicated soldiers of the Imperium, risking their very souls to fight in defence of the Emperor’s realm. Indeed, while most officers would be loathe to admit it, a squad or two of Wyrdvane Psykers is often worth several times their number of ‘proper’ Imperial Guardsmen. ^^Of course, this is not always the case. After all, the dangers of manipulating the powers of the Warp are very real, and the psykers’ comrades fear their unnatural abilities for good reason. Horror stories abound amongst the Imperial Guard of Wyrdvane Psykers bursting spontaneously aflame in the midst of battle, or else becoming possessed by terrible entities and slaughtering friend and foe alike. However, the Scholastica Psykana’s screening stamps out many such potential disasters before they can occur, and for every uncontrolled explosion of Warp energy there are a dozen battles where the Wyrdvanes prove their worth. ^^As Humanity’s psychic potential squirms ever closer to the surface, Wyrdvane Psykers become an increasingly common sight in the ranks of the Imperial Guard. Indeed, as the hour darkens and Mankind’s cause becomes ever more desperate, some whisper darkly that these dangerous mutants may one day replace good honest soldiers altogether. ^^“What can a man know of the Universe who knows not his own mind?” ^^———Book of the Astronomican"

# "A Sanctioned Psyker is a human psyker who plays an ordained role as a servant of the Imperium of Man, for he has the rare willpower to control his abilities and not become a danger to others. A Sanctioned Psyker's exact role depends on the psychic powers he manifests and his strength of character and will. The Scholastica Psykana, the training division of the Adeptus Astra Telepathica, is a vast teaching institution devoted to the training of young Imperial psykers, who are taught how to develop and control their powers to serve the Imperium. Most of the psyker recruits are drawn from the levy collected by the Black Ships, others are handed over by the Inquisition, the Adeptus Arbites or through other Imperial channels. The future of each psyker depends on his abilities and character. Initial evaluation divides the levy into several groups depending on their innate psychic power, individual character and willingness to learn. The youngest psykers are preferred by the Scholastica Psykana, as these frightened boys and girls are the easiest to train and indoctrinate. Such psykers are soul-bound to the Emperor, a psychic ritual that hardens their minds and souls against possession by the daemonic entities of the Warp. It is invariably those psykers recruited as children who are given further training to fill important positions in the Imperium as Sanctioned Psykers. Astropaths are the most common Sanctioned Psykers in the Imperium, having escaped the cruel fate that awaits those without the strength of mind to control their powers, or the will and determination to survive the Imperium's strict training regimes. ^^“What can a man know of the Universe who knows not his own mind?” ^^———Book of the Astronomican"

# astra_militarum_tempestus_scion_commander1
# astra_militarum_2x2_tempestus_scion_commander1
# Militarum Tempestus Scions are cold, proficient killers whose deadly firepower can reduce swathes of foes to smouldering heaps of corpses. Trained in the Schola Progenium, these men commit to a rigorous program of physical and mental indoctrination that raises them to the peak of human conditioning. Loyal to the Emperor above all else, Tempestus Scions provide High Command with a core of flexible, nigh-incorruptible soldiers. Deployed sparingly, they can be depended upon to complete any mission, no matter how deadly. Racing into battle aboard armoured transports or plummeting down on grav-chutes, the Scions are the sharp edge of the Imperial Guard war machine.
# TEMPESTUS COMMAND SQUAD
# Each Militarum Tempestus Platoon is led into battle by a grizzled officer known as a Tempestor Prime. Such men are promoted on battlefield record alone, their courage and discipline unshakeable. The Command Squad that accompanies them comprise cold-eyed killers whose every thought and deed is intended to further the Imperial cause. Able to operate on their own initiative in a way entirely alien to the majority of the Imperial Guard, these men lead their Progenium brethren into battle with merciless efficiency.
# TEMPESTUS SCIONS
# Each squad of Tempestus Scions consists of veteran warriors, trained and equipped to the highest standard.

# Scout Sentinel WS3 BS3 S5 F10 S10 R10 I3 A1 HP2
# Unit Type:
# Vehicle (Walker, Open-topped)
# Unit Composition:
# 1 Scout Sentinel
# Wargear:
# • Multi-laser
# Special Rules:
# • Move Through Cover
# • Scout
# Options:
# • May include up to two additional Scout Sentinels..........35 pts/model
# • Any Scout Sentinel may take items from the Astra Militarum Vehicle Equipment list.
# • Any Scout Sentinel may replace its multi-laser with one of the following:
# - Heavy flamer..........free
# - Autocannon..........5 pts/model
# - Missile launcher..........5 pts/model
# - Lascannon..........10 pts/model

# The Support Sentinel is a heavily-armed variation designed to provide immediate fire support, either as part of a Sentinel company or attached to infantry platoons. It is armed with a Multiple Rocket Pod for anti-infantry firepower, or a Missile Launcher capable of firing Frag and Krak missiles. It is also modified with additional range-finder and target acquisition gear, including a Targeter mounted on a telescopic periscope, allowing those armed with a Missile Launcher to fire at targets outside their line of sight. Additional modifications include an armoured screen to protect the pilot against missile jet-wash, and a Drop pattern variant which incorporates the Drop Sentinel's design features. Support Sentinels are uncommon, with each Sentinel company lucky to have one or two squadrons, so they are highly valued by their commanders.

spr2 "w40kmod/astra_militarum_2x2_sentinel1.tga"
descr "The Elysian Pattern Sentinel or Drop Sentinel are a variant used exclusively by Drop Regiments of the Imperial Guard such as the Elysian Drop Troops. More compact than other versions and fitted with Grav-chutes, Drop Sentinels are deployed from high orbit or mounted inside Valkyrie airborne assault carriers in order to quickly enter the combat zone. For this purpose they have modifications made to their power plant and cab to allow it to fit inside a transport once its legs are folded away. Unlike other patterns, Drop Sentinels are generally not used as scouts, instead filling the role of mobile heavy support for drop regiments that otherwise lack ground-based armoured vehicles or heavy weapons. One of such battles was when Drop Sentinels of the 23rd Elysian Regiment were engaged in assault and the subsequent defence of Hydro-plants 23-30. The battle rage for three days and all of the Regiment’s 42 vehicles were destroyed. The normal weapons configuration is either a Heavy Bolter or Multi-melta. ^^The Sentinel is a fast-moving combat walker employed to scout dense terrain and provide close infantry fire support. With surprising speed and locomotive dexterity, Sentinels can traverse terrain that would confound other armoured vehicles. The lighter-armoured Scout Sentinels, in particular, are used to range ahead of the main battle line, setting up brutal ambushes or launching pin-point raids. The enclosed forms of Armoured Sentinels fulfil a different role, exchanging the Scout Sentinels’ agility for increased durability and a wider range of heavy weapons to duel with enemy tanks."

spr1 "w40kmod/astra_militarum_2x2_sentinel6.tga" 
spr2 "w40kmod/astra_militarum_2x2_sentinel6.tga"
descr "The Catachan Pattern Sentinel originated on Catachan and is often employed by other regiments native to Death Worlds. Adapted towards the claustrophobic close-quarters common to jungle fighting, it is armed with a Heavy Flamer and carries a massive chainsaw cutting tool, useful not only for clearing brush but also the enemy as well. ^^The Sentinel is a fast-moving combat walker employed to scout dense terrain and provide close infantry fire support. With surprising speed and locomotive dexterity, Sentinels can traverse terrain that would confound other armoured vehicles. The lighter-armoured Scout Sentinels, in particular, are used to range ahead of the main battle line, setting up brutal ambushes or launching pin-point raids. The enclosed forms of Armoured Sentinels fulfil a different role, exchanging the Scout Sentinels’ agility for increased durability and a wider range of heavy weapons to duel with enemy tanks."

descr "Sentinel Powerlifters are a rear-echelon variant used primarily for loading and unloading equipment and supplies. These Sentinels are equipped with large hydraulic claws, also known as a Powerlifter, easily capable of crushing a man to death, along with a counterweight mounted on the rear to prevent it from tipping over. They are a common sight on airfields, space ship flight decks, and artillery positions, but will only be called upon to defend their position as a last desperate measure. ^^The Sentinel is a fast-moving combat walker employed to scout dense terrain and provide close infantry fire support.

# Wargear:
# • Flak armour
# • Laspistol
# • Close combat weapon
# • Hunting lance

# "In a galaxy overrun by vast engines of war, many would deem the notion of men on horseback a worthless anachronism, yet Rough Riders hailing from worlds such as Attila put the lie to this belief. Commonly recruited from the backwards populations of feral or feudal worlds, Rough Rider units use their heritage as expert cavalrymen to perform a number of disparate tactical roles for the Imperial Guard in battle. These fierce men and their equally irascible steeds can move far faster than ground-slogging infantry, even over rough terrain, and thus fulfil duties as long range scouts or counter-charging shock troops with equal ease."

spr1 "w40kmod/astra_militarum_2x2_hellhound1.tga"
spr2 "w40kmod/astra_militarum_2x2_hellhound1.tga"
descr "Sacrificing the Chimera’s transport capacity for larger engines and bulky canisters of volatile promethium, the Hellhound sports a monstrous turret-mounted flame-thrower that  discharges a self-igniting chemical. Typically deployed in dense terrain, the Hellhound excels at flushing dug-in infantry from their bunkers and boltholes. The roar and hiss of chemical flames fills the air as the Hellhound’s inferno cannon opens fire. Fat sizzles and ammunition explodes as enemy infantry reel screaming from cover, ablaze from head to toe. As oily, reeking smoke fills the air, the survivors fall back in desperate disarray. ^^The Hellhound’s only real disadvantage is the comparatively short range of its primary armament, a limitation that forces it to close with the foe during battle. When coupled with the understanding that a fully fuelled Hellhound is a massive firebomb waiting to happen, it is unsurprising that most Hellhound crews are drawn from punishment details and somewhat unhinged volunteers. These men, however, take a perverse pride in their maverick reputations. Many Hellhound crews, treated to the front-row spectacle of heretics and aliens burning in the fires of Imperial justice, begin to see their duties as akin to religious cleansing – such pious pyromania leads to fatalism and risk-taking, but also encourages deadly, enthusiastic efficiency."

spr2 "w40kmod/astra_militarum_2x2_hellhound_devil_dog_meltacannon1.tga"
descr "The Devil Dog replaces the Hellhound’s primary armament with a snub-nosed melta cannon. Acquiring its name from the high-pitched howl this weapon makes upon firing, the Devil Dog is capable of punching far above its weight in armoured combat. Indeed, many Devil Dog crews style themselves as big game hunters or monster slayers, excelling in the eradication of enemy armour and exceptionally heavy infantry assets. A foe forced to fight protracted campaigns in dense terrain against the Imperial Guard soon learns to dread the hunched silhouette of the Devil Dog – those who don’t soon find their vehicles reduced to molten slag by this aggressive and fast moving tank hunter. ^^“We flooded that bunker with fire and watched the heretics burn till they was nothin’ but ash on the wind. It was beautiful Sarge, just... beautiful.” ^———Gunner 'Scorch' Hennessey, Catachan IX Armoured"

spr2 "w40kmod/astra_militarum_2x2_hellhound_bane_wolf_chemcannon1.tga"
descr "A deceptively simple adaptation of the Hellhound, the Bane Wolf replaces its promethium with bulky canisters of toxic gas. This incredibly corrosive fume has been certified by the Adeptus Biologis as inimical to almost every lifeform in the galaxy. Ejected from the tank’s chem cannon in hissing jets, the hideous substance chews through ceramite and chitin alike in microseconds. The victim is dissolved by the virulent chemicals, blood boiling and organs rupturing even as their skin erupts into bubbling lesions and sloughs from their crumbling bone until the targets are reduced to a slick of organic sludge to be ground beneath the tank’s whirring tracks. Commonly, Bane Wolf crews are remote, taciturn individuals who do not mix with other Guardsmen. Their vehicles are as likely to see action quelling the uprisings of traitorous human cults as they are against deadly xenos threats, and to deploy the chem cannon against fellow humans, no matter how debased, can be a harrowing experience. It takes a particular kind of nihilist to crew such a short ranged and grotesque terror weapon."

descr "The Valkyrie Assault Carrier and its sister gunship the Vendetta are well-armed, twin-engine attack craft. The durable armour and versatile payload of the Valkyrie chassis combine with the aircraft’s powerful engines and stable handling to make it a popular choice for a broad spectrum of battlefield roles. ^^Sporting a troop transport capacity on par with the ubiquitous Chimera, the Valkyrie is often used to swiftly redeploy squads of infantry. Strikes at key targets by cadres of Tempestus Scions, reinforcement of buckling battle lines by grim faced bands of Veterans, even hasty transportation for ranking officers – all of these and more are the duty of the Valkyrie. By comparison, the Vendetta Gunship cuts its transport capacity to make room for additional fuel cells and servo-capacitors. Though these modifications subject unfortunate passengers to waves of noise and heat, this is more than made up for by the substantial up-gunning of the aircraft itself. A battery of lascannons jut aggressively from the Vendetta’s wings and muzzle, a fearsome payload for an aircraft of its size which permits the airborne hunting of heavy armour and monstrous beasts alike. ^^With a few notable exceptions, most Imperial Guard formations will have small numbers of Valkyries and Vendettas attached to them on a temporary basis; such craft are, first and foremost, the property of the Imperial Navy. During extended ground operations, however, they are usually repainted to match their assigned regiment, and their pilots report directly to that regiment’s senior officer. ^^With vectored engines permitting vertical take-off and landing, these versatile aircraft can twist and turn through the rigours of low-altitude dogfights, or hover while troops rappel from their holds. Alternatively, every Valkyrie and Vendetta is equipped with sufficient gravchutes for all passengers, allowing expedient, if hazardous, high-speed deployment. These aircraft have a storied history of service alongside Imperial infantry and armour regiments, and are sometimes referred to by Imperial Guardsmen as the Wings of the Emperor. Certainly those Guardsmen who have seen a ravening Carnifex cut apart from on high by a Vendetta’s lascannons, or been lifted from the path of an onrushing Ork horde in the rugged confines of a Valkyrie, have nothing but respect for these exceptional aircraft."

descr "A Tank Commander rides to battle in the cupola of a mighty Leman Russ battle tank. These grizzled men are virtually one with their machine, possessing an implicit knowledge of armoured warfare in all its forms. Granted their pick of the armoured fighting vehicles available to their regiment, they are further entitled to pick their crew from the finest veterans. The average Tank Commander is therefore a steely eyed ace, heading up a crew of the very best their regiment has to offer. ^^A Tank Commander will always be found leading a squadron of Leman Russ battle tanks, their coolly delivered orders greatly augmenting the effectiveness of their squadmates. Whether directing deadly salvoes into onrushing xenos or clashing with collossal enemy war machines, the Tank Commander and his squadron have few equals. However, for all their armoured might, it is a Tank Commander’s fusion of combat experience and bellicose leadership that makes them especially deadly. ^^These veteran armour commanders will often be assigned temporary leadership of infantry or artillery assets. This may see the Tank Commander’s’ squadron line-breaking at the head of an overwhelming infantry offensive, or digging in to provide close cover for thundering batteries of big guns. Whatever the case, the Tank Commander’s strategic cunning and deadly armoured steed can anchor an entire battle line, or smash that of the foe asunder. Infantrymen may grumble when assigned to the command of a ‘tread-head’, mistrusting such a man’s grasp of the hardships faced by honest footsloggers, yet such complaints soon turn to cheers when the commander’s tank squadron rolls into the foe’s ranks, all guns blazing and tracks churning enemy bodies to bloody paste. ^^The standard Leman Russ’ versatile weapon-fit and hefty battle cannon ensure it is capable of facing down almost any battlefield target. ^^The Leman Russ battle tank is an ironclad declaration of might made manifest.

descr "Short ranged but deadly, the demolisher siege cannon trades reach for power. Each demolisher shell is at least three times the size of a normal battle cannon round, its huge weight and high explosive core ensuring it will annihilate almost anything it hits. The utter lethality of the Demolisher’s primary armament makes it the undisputed king of the close range firefight.^^The Leman Russ battle tank is an ironclad declaration of might made manifest. They are the mainstay of the Imperial Guard’s armoured forces, lumbering slabs of armour and intolerance whose inexorable advance has ground a billion foes of the Imperium to bloody ruin. ^^What the Leman Russ lacks in speed, it more than makes up for in brute force and survivability. Enemy fire patters from its inches-thick armour like dust on the wind. Between its sponsons, hull and turret the Russ carries enough firepower to pound almost any foe into submission. The tank’s rugged simplicity and ease of manufacture ensures that the Imperium can field whole companies of Leman Russ with ease, burying the outnumbered foe beneath waves of irresistible armoured fury. ^^Dedicated Leman Russ tank companies play a key role in Imperial strategy, and the greatest Imperial tank offensives will see armoured formations many miles in breadth sweep all before them in a rumbling tide. However, it is common to see armoured companies broken into squadrons to support infantry and artillery elements in the field. The presence of even one Leman Russ can bolster the fighting strength and morale of Imperial Guard infantry enormously, while a whole squadron of such armoured brutes wields serious destructive power. Leman Russ squadrons can be deployed to spearhead an all-out offensive, reduce an enemy breakthrough to a tangle of blood-soaked wreckage, or safeguard the thundering guns of an artillery company from attack. With its many common variants, the Leman Russ is a versatile and deadly tool in the arsenal of any Imperial Guard commander."

descr "Whether faced by lightning-fast xenos fighters or daemonic, leather-winged monstrosities, the Hydra Flak Tank is ideally equipped to blow aerial foes out of the sky. The Hydra’s predictive logic-spirit singles out and locks onto its targets with the tenacity of a predatory beast. Autoloaders engage with a rising whine as the Hydra’s turret traverses, its autocannons howling as they fill the air with sawing lines of deadly firepower. Few airborne enemies, no matter how debased or unnatural, can survive for long once they are locked in the Hydra’s sights. ^^Though the Hydra has sufficient armour to weather a fair degree of punishment, it is intended primarily as a support vehicle rather than a main line battle tank. Faced by ground targets, the Hydra has only a limited range of options for its own defence and may face being overwhelmed by a determined assault. However, when attached to armour or infantry formations, the doughty tank really comes into its own. Even a lone Hydra can throw up a storm of flak, swatting enemy aircraft from the skies with an adamantine fist. When several of these vehicles draw up and open fire, the devastation wrought on airborne foes is spectacular. With sufficient infantry or tanks to guard them from direct attack, the Hydras can remain safe from harm while concentrating their efforts on keeping the skies clear. ^^For most Imperial Guardsmen, be they artillery crew, tankers or foot-slogging infantry, the screaming approach of enemy aircraft is a sound that evokes absolute dread. When the black shadow of monstrous wings falls across them, the men of the Guard have little defence besides prayer. So it is that the Hydra has acquired a reputation as an omen of good luck. With nicknames ranging from ‘steel saviours’ to the more colloquial ‘bug-zapper’, Hydras are viewed with comradely affection by most Imperial Guardsmen. A common tradition amongst the men of many regiments is to rap their knuckles against the hull of a Hydra before battle; this so-called ‘angel’s knock’ is performed in solemn silence and intended to draw the vigilance of the Hydra’s machine spirit in the battle to come. Hydra crews share in their vehicles’ popularity, enjoying something approaching folk-hero status amongst their comrades and a place around any squad’s campfire. Some Hydra crewmen revel in the regard of their comrades and the adrenaline rush of their duty, while others find the weight of responsibility uncomfortable, but few are foolish enough to believe the camaraderie of their fellows is untainted by self-interest. ^^Regardless of their crews’ attitudes or affectations, when Hydras roll into battle they can make all the difference to an Imperial Guard army. On Sarentos III, during the battle of the Sandsea, the Cadian 1652nd Armoured were tasked with breaking the Necron line. Roaring across the dunes, the Leman Russ squadrons of the 1652nd directed a withering rain of fire into their deathless foes. Great geysers of crimson sand were blown high into the air as the Necron line disintegrated before the tankers’ armoured charge. Then came the Doom Scythes. Screaming over the battlefield on howling repulsor-jets, several wings of the ominous alien craft began to strafe the Imperial tanks with the glowing beams of their death rays. Flames billowed and black smoke gouted forth as first one Leman Russ and then another exploded. For a perilous moment it appeared as though the 1652nd would be hurled back in disarray – yet their commander had issued his own call for support, and barrelling over the crest of a nearby dune came three Hydras. Tracks churning spumes of sand in their wake, the flak tanks marked their targets and opened fire, filling the sky with fury. One after another, the Necron attack craft were riddled with holes – flurries of sparks and crackling green lightning wreathed their hulls as the Doom Scythes plummeted to the dunes below, tumbling end over end and exploding with enormous force. As the last of the enemy aircraft turned tail and fled, the surviving tanks of the 1652nd pushed forward again, their route to victory now covered by the watchful guns of the Hydras."

descr "When the Imperial Guard go to war, they march to the thunderous report of batteries of Basilisks whose guns can flatten cities and end worlds. Instantly recognisable for the long, looming barrel of its earthshaker cannon, the Basilisk boasts a prodigious range. ^^The far-reaching, massed firepower of these tanks is one of the most deadly and reliable tools at the disposal of High Command. Gaping holes can be blown in enemy battle lines to pave the way for spearhead assaults. The mightiest bastions can be crushed to rubble beneath remorseless bombardments that last for days. Enemy mobility is restricted by rolling carpets of explosions that creep inexorably forward, leaving nothing in their wake but corpse-strewn craters and smouldering wreckage. Fast moving or elusive threats such as Dark Eldar raiding parties or Tyranid scout-beasts find their unnatural abilities useless as they are caught in blast-zones many kilometres across. Most importantly, long range bombardment by Basilisks can eliminate at a distance those threats too powerful or potentially corrupting for Guard forces to face at close quarters. Towering Bio-titans, waves of gibbering Daemons, Tau battlesuits with the power to atomise columns of attacking armour – all are pounded to ruin by the relentless attentions of massed artillery fire. ^^Individual Basilisks or batteries thereof are often broken away from their parent formations and attached to infantry and armour regiments. Such an arrangement allows the artillery vehicles to perform the same tasks as a full company but on a localised scale. Under the muzzles of the Basilisks’ guns, howling mobs of Orks disappear in blizzards of shrapnel. Fortifications are broken open, ready for assault by grim-faced waves of Guardsmen. Spikestudded heretic battle-tanks are left as ruptured wrecks, while xenos warriors that would leave trails of Guardsmen dead in their wake are contemptuously blown to pieces amid volleys of plummeting shells. No matter how unnaturally gifted the foe, their deviant blessings are as nought in the face of such earth-shaking firepower. ^^Imperial Guard infantry derive huge benefits from being assigned dedicated Basilisks to support them in the field. Indeed, among many regiments it is considered a manifest sign of good luck to be assigned ordnance cover. However it should not be forgotten that the arrangement is mutually beneficial. The galaxy is teeming with foes that can make short work of slow moving, cumbersome targets like Basilisks at close quarters – a few good squads of foot-sloggers to scrape the xenos off your hull can mean the difference between life and death for Imperial artillerymen. ^^From the earliest days of the Imperium, Basilisks have proved their worth on battlefields beyond counting. At the siege of Kanza, batteries of Basilisks threw down the gates of the Endless Fortress amid a rain of flame and fury, clearing the way for tank columns to press home the attack. During the Jourgol Blitz, when the traitor Titan End of Days broke through the Vostroyan lines and annihilated High Marshal Gostov’s command Leviathan, it was a point-blank bombardment of Basilisk fire that brought down the monstrous Daemon Engine’s shields and brought it to its knees. No matter the foe, every Imperial Guard commander knows that there is nothing that cannot be solved with enough big guns.^^“Identify your target. Concentrate your fire on it to the exclusion of all else. When it is destroyed, choose another target. That is the way to secure victory!” ^———The Tactica Imperium"

spr2 "w40kmod/astra_militarum_2x2_wyvern1.tga"
descr "The Wyvern Suppression Tank exchanges the Hydra’s anti-aircraft autocannons for a pair of twin-linked stormshard mortars. The tank excels in the claustrophobic environment of urban warfare, raining curtains of shrapnel down upon luckless enemy infantry without ever exposing itself to harm. ^^Utilising a bastardised version of the Hydra’s auto-targeting systems, the Wyvern runs constant proximity sweeps for concentrations of enemy infantry. The machine spirits of these vehicles are renowned for their malicious streak – they actively seek the most tight-packed or vulnerable groupings of the foe and strain to target them, sometimes even overriding the commands of their crews. When the tanks do let fly, their stormshard mortars emit a distinctive, whooshing roar as they spew clouds of shells high into the air. This sound becomes the dread of enemy forces facing batteries of Wyverns in dense terrain – it is inevitably followed by the howl of those same shells descending, the crackling booms of their detonation and the harrowing screams of the maimed and dying. ^^Specialising in close-ranged saturation bombardment, the Wyvern fills a very different niche to the Basilisk. Though lacking the all-out stopping power to fell heavy war engines, Wyverns excel in generating an all-consuming storm of shrapnel from which there can be no escape. A battery of these belligerent artillery tanks can fill a street from end to end with whistling, razor-edged death, relentlessly pounding enemy infantry until nothing is left but bloody mulch and drifting smoke. Cover will not avail their victims, for their shells plunge down from on high and there is nowhere that their airbursting rounds cannot reach. Undergrowth is torn to shreds, flakboard and barricades perforated. Those crouched in craters, trenches or gun-pits find their sanctuaries turned suddenly to death-traps as they fill with whizzing metal and spattering blood. ^^In a galaxy where many of Mankind’s enemies leave Imperial Guardsmen with a feeling of powerlessness and inadequacy, so vindictive a weapon is popular amongst the men. Nothing restores an Imperial Guardsman’s faith like watching arrogant Eldar or terrifying Daemons reduced to flailing, frantic madness by the relentless shelling of a Wyvern battery. For their sheer spectacle alone these tanks are worth their weight in gold, not only devastating the enemy’s forces but reducing them to a powerless, terrified mass as they die. ^^The Wyvern is a very versatile weapon for an artillery tank – whole batteries of them can certainly be drawn up to pound a foe into oblivion, but more often they are attached in small numbers to other formations. Even a single Wyvern can provide an Infantry Platoon with invaluable close-range fire support, fending off waves of enemies that might otherwise overrun the hapless Imperial Guardsmen. When deployed in support of other tanks, Wyverns prove invaluable in keeping at bay those infantry threats that would attack the vehicles’ vulnerable flanks and rear. ^^Wyverns can strike directly at concentrations of the foe in order to clear a path, or spread their fire out in ‘area-denial’ bombardments that force even the most tenacious defenders to quit their posts or die. Even ultra-fast targets such as jetbikes find themselves cut to pieces by experienced Wyvern crews, who will lead their fire so as to ensure airburst directly above the victim just as it passes through the target area. Each such successful hit elicits a growl of satisfaction from the Wyvern’s bloodthirsty machine spirit, even as its sensors hunt eagerly for the next luckless victim. ^^“Hiding in the trees are they? Let’s see those grox-lovers hide from this!” ^———Gunnery Seneschal Bromner, Wyvern 'Rain of Absolution'"

descr "The Manticore Rocket Launcher is an ancient siege engine that dates back to the earliest days of the Imperium. Once, these potent artillery tanks mounted a variety of devastating warheads. Over time, as forge worlds have fallen and technological lore has been lost behind the veil of mythology, the Manticore’s versatility has lessened. Though some variants still exist in far flung corners of the Imperium, it is the Munitorum standard for Manticores to go into battle bearing four mighty storm eagle rockets. These munitions are by far the most powerful remaining Manticore armament, and are more than capable of causing unsustainable levels of damage to any foe. ^^Each storm eagle rocket is a self-contained arsenal. Mounted upon a single-stage booster and fitted with guidance and detonation-augurs, these munitions are capable of extreme range bombardment. The storm eagle warhead contains concentric racks of high explosive bomblets, each soaked in sacred unguents of the Mechanicus and hand-scribed with the One Hundred Canticles of Wrath. Soaring across the battlefield upon a contrail of flame, the storm eagle descends upon its target like an avenging angel. The deafening roar of the rocket’s approach causes foes to abase themselves in terror, or flee screaming in a hopeless attempt at self-preservation. Directly above the target-zone the blessed warhead fragments to unleash its payload, bomblets raining down across a wide area. Tanks are sent cart-wheeling, or are pulverised by concussive blasts. Infantry are atomised or hurled into the air, blackened bodies tumbling down around the blast-zone like fallen leaves. Each warhead spawns a thunderous carpet of detonations that leave nought but wrath-strewn ashes in their wake. ^^Though its potency is undeniable, the Manticore is an ancient machine and prone to exhibiting considerable technological eccentricities. To reload a Manticore requires several hours of careful, uninterrupted ministration by a crew of Tech-Priests and specialist Servitors. This process absolutely cannot be undertaken in the field, rendering the tank’s ammunition reserve finite. This is coupled with the fact that the sheer antiquity of the surviving Manticores has rendered their machine spirits truculent and temperamental. If prevailing conditions are not to the tank’s liking or its systems are treated without due delicacy, the Manticore has been known to malfunction in a most wilful manner. Storm eagle rockets deviate wildly off course, fall uselessly out of the air, or ignore the depression of launch runes with curmudgeonly indifference. A Manticore crew will commonly bow to their machine before and after combat, beg its permission before discharging its weapons, and maintain a near-constant mantra of prayer and obeisance in battle with the aim of mollifying their armoured steed, yet still these difficulties are commonplace. ^^Despite the Manticore’s unpredictable streak, many commanders consider the rewards of their successful employment more than worth the gamble. A single Manticore is adjudged by the Munitorum to be equal in material value to an entire battery of lesser ordnance, and with good reason. When the tanks are attached to Imperial Guard regiments for support, most officers employ them as terror weapons at a pivotal moment, using the might of the Manticore to deliver the decisive killing blow."

# No Ordinary Weapon: A deathstrike missile cannot be destroyed by a Weapon Destroyed result, only delayed. Similarly a Crew Stunned or Crew Shaken result does not prevent a Deathstrike missile from launching (see below). 
# The Hour is Nigh: The Deathstrike Missile Launcher may not fire on the first turn of the game, or if it has moved earlier in the turn it wishes to fire. In the Shooting phase, if you wish to fire the Deathstrike Missile, roll a D6 with the following modifiers:
# - Each full, consecutive game turn in which the Deathstrike Missile Launcher has not moved: +1.
# - Each Weapon Destroyed result applied to the Deathstrike Missile itself: -1.
# If the result is a 4 or more, the Deathstrike missile can be fired. Note that a natural roll of a 6 will always result in the missile firing, regardless of negative modifiers.

descr "A rare few weapons within the Imperial Guard arsenal are considered so destructive that to sanction their deployment without due cause and clear purpose is a capital offence. Such weapons are designated ‘Ordnance Extremis’ by the Munitorum. Chief among these implements of destruction is the Deathstrike Missile Launcher.^^The Deathstrike exhibits huge range and destructive capability, launching a single intercontinental ballistic missile of intimidating size. Able to visit the wrath of the Emperor upon targets half a world away, the Deathstrike can mount a variety of horrifying payloads. Until recently, however, it was a weapon in decline. The deployment of a single Deathstrike Missile Launcher requires a huge investment of resources; the acquisition of these weapons is a process littered with religious and administrative complexities, and can take months. As a slow moving asset whose deployment is time-consuming and arcane, the Deathstrike often requires its own dedicated escort and presents the foe with a valuable and relatively soft target. For the Departmento Munitorum, simple logistics has precluded its deployment in all but the most extreme circumstances. ^^This is not to say that Deathstrike Missile Launchers have not seen use, for their formidable value and situational versatility are legendary. With a single successful launch the Deathstrike can bring down an enemy Titan, punching the towering war engine from its feet amid the false sun of a reactor meltdown. One well placed warhead can deliver virulent pathogens to the heart of an army, wipe out the entire command structure of the foe in a holocaust of billowing plasma, or crush the morale of a wavering enemy with its sudden, godlike wrath. Most terrifying of all are the venerated Vortex missiles. These warheads are able to sunder reality itself in a roiling wave of Warp energy that guarantees the annihilation of anything caught in their blast. Vortex warheads are so rare that the improper launch of one is punishable by immediate summary execution. ^^It is a mark of how dark the days of the Imperium have become of late that a brutal new tactic has appeared, one that has seen the Deathstrike experience a renaissance. Held behind Imperial lines, Deathstrikes lurk out of sight, remaining undetected while they await their moment. When enemy forces threaten catastrophic breakthrough, or a suitably valuable target presents itself, waves of infantry are sent to bog the enemy down. Fed short range combat-launch coordinates, the Deathstrike Missile Launchers discharge their terrifying weapons directly into the heart of battle. As the missile descends, friend and foe alike risk immolation amid the unleashed blast-wave. Such measures are as inhumane as they are desperate, yet in these times no sacrifice is too great to ensure the survival of Mankind."

descr "Many and varied are the ancient technologies which go into producing a true Baneblade, making it more advanced than most other Imperial Guard vehicles. Besides its Searchlight the tank is packed with auspex gear, such as seismic sensors, with a multitude of augur lenses ringing the tank's outer hull. Targeting arrays and two periscopes atop the tank's turret allow the commander a clearer view of the battlefield thanks to their prodigious height. In addition the commander can look out through any of his gunner's scopes and designate targets for them, assisted by the tank's logic engines in locating an enemy's weak points. Short- and long-range vox equipment allows for communication anywhere up to orbiting satellites, while special pulse-laser comms systems allows the Baneblade to share data with other super-heavy tanks to form a logic engine network; regular vehicles retrofitted with these systems can also join in. All of the information the Baneblade receives from these many sources are combined and displayed on the three-dimensional map chart located behind the commander's station. Here an accurate map of the tank's surroundings as well as all friendly and enemy contacts are displayed, allowing the commander to plan out his operations. ^^The roar of the Baneblade’s engines rolls like thunder across the battlefield, bearing with it the promise of certain death. Mighty tracks grind over the shuddering ground as the tank advances, crunching flesh and bone, rubble and wreckage with equal ease. Enemies flee before this embodiment of Imperial supremacy, their fire pattering uselessly from the Baneblade’s armoured hull. In return, the tank’s arsenal swings to bear, turrets and sponson guns loosing a cacophonous volley of death into the midst of the foe. Lascannon beams and massive artillery shells plough through armoured targets, tearing them apart in fierce explosions. Gales of heavy bolter fire and blasts of flame mow down enemy infantry without mercy. None can stand against the Baneblade, and those that try do not live to regret their mistake."

descr "The sheer concussion of the Banehammer’s cannon opening fire is enough to burst eardrums and crack armaglass. Yet this wall of sound is nothing compared to the fury unleashed when the tank’s shell hits home. A raging thermobaric shockwave roars out from the point of impact, bursting organs, immolating flesh and melting armour with equal ease. At the same time, savage tremors race through the ground. Warriors are flung from their feet with bone-breaking force, vehicles spin out of control, and luckless foes scream their last as they plunge down hungry fissures that yawn beneath them. By the time the Banehammer’s complement of infantry disembarks into the fight, there is little for them to do but mop up the shellshocked survivors of the monstrous tank’s wrath."

Around its flanks come masses of Astra Militarum soldiery, storming through the remains of enemy strongpoints beneath whose walls they had – just hours before – been dying by the hundred. Supported by the hammering guns of the Banesword, the men of the Imperial Guard show no mercy to their persecutors, slaughtering with relish those defenders still left standing."

descr "The Doomhammer is a Super Heavy Tank which was created from the necessity for Titan-killing vehicles during the thousand-year-long siege of Ordana. ^^ During the siege, many commanders requested Shadowswords to combat the large number of heavy armour in the form of Titans and tanks from a renegade forge world. The only way the Imperium could maintain the war effort was to retrofit their Banehammers with magma cannons. While the magma cannon's range or area of effect are not the equal of the Shadowsword's volcano cannon, it can still deal a death blow to Titans. Since shells did not have to be carried and the retrofits did not take up too much space, the Doomhammer also gained a small transport capability. ^^^A superlative linebreaker, the Doomhammer is equal parts close-range Titan killer and massive, rolling fortress. Typically it is held back until the perfect moment, and then the Doomhammer advances unstoppably. Explosions blossom across its hull, and flames wash over the armoured plates without ever harming the soldiers riding within or slowing the giant tank in the slightest. In return, heavy bolters and sponson guns howl their fury, blasting apart tanks and cutting down infantry with equal ease. Yet it is when the Doomhammer’s magma cannon opens fire that true devastation is unleashed. A single shot from this apocalyptic weapon is capable of blowing an Ork Stompa sky high, or smashing the leg from a traitor Titan to send it crashing to the ground in flames."

descr "The Hellhammer was built to provide short-ranged fire support in difficult conditions (like city fights). It certainly excels at this role, as its main weapon, the Hellhammer cannon, can exterminate defenders no matter where they are hiding or what armour they are wearing (although the devastation is contained within a small area). However, its formidable armament doesn't end there - it is also armed with co-axial Autocannons, Demolisher cannons, Twin-linked Heavy Bolters and Lascannons and Twin-linked Heavy Flamers in each of the side sponsons. ^^The Hellhammer's primary powerplant is a Phaeton pattern 110 square kilo-cubits Adaptable Thermic Combuster, supported by a Gravis pattern Thaumic Resonance Crystal Generation Unit. Besides the standard Smoke Launchers and Searchlight it can be adapted to mount a Hunter-Killer Missile and/or a pintle-mounted Heavy Stubber/Storm Bolter. Some Hellhammers will replace the side sponsons with extra armour or even add two additional side sponsons, each armed with a Lascannon and twin-linked Heavy Flamers. ^^^Advancing into the tight confines of an urban war zone is many a warrior’s worst nightmare. Any shadowed doorway or window may harbour a lurking foe, while every intersection and open space is a howling storm of crossfire waiting to happen. The Hellhammer is designed to make a mockery of such terrifying arenas, its fearsome armaments optimised for close range fire fights. Grinding forward through the hell of ruined cityscapes and tangled fortifications, the huge tank plays its fire across dug-in foes, flushing them out with gouts of flame or bringing the very buildings that conceal them crashing down on their heads. Meanwhile, the Hellhammer’s main cannon, though short ranged, packs an enormous punch and is capable of taking out even the greatest enemy war engines with one decisive shot."

descr "The Shadowsword is primarily distinguished from its sister design by its main weapon, the Volcano Cannon. This massive laser cannon can tear off a Titan's limb with a single shot and is assisted by advanced logis-engines and targeting equipment for accurate long-range fire. The power needed to produce this devastating blow is drawn from the Shadowsword's capacitors, which themselves draw power from the tank's engine, however just one shot will completely drain them. In order to recharge the capacitors the engine's main drive must be disconnected and the generator connected in its place, rendering the tank stationary. This process is overseen by a dedicated Enginseer, whether an actual member of the Adeptus Mechanicus or a highly-trained Imperial Guard specialist, who monitors the power flow from engine to generator and otherwise helps maintain the vehicle. ^^On average it can take a Shadowsword two minutes to fully charge its four-terawatt capacitors, assuming its systems are functioning normally. Because of its slow rate of fire the Shadowsword often operates with lighter vehicles who protect it against enemy assaults and help initiate an attack on an enemy Titan. While the Shadowsword lies in ambush the smaller vehicles attempt to strip the enemy's Void Shields at which point the Shadowsword may deliver the killing blow. ^^For defence, the Shadowsword has two remote-controlled side sponsons fitted with Twin-linked Heavy Bolters or Heavy Flamers. Some Shadowswords will instead replace these sponsons for extra armouring or add a second set of sponsons, each fitted with the same weapons as the originals. In addition to this, many crews will install a pintle-mounted Storm Bolter or Heavy Stubber, and/or a Hunter-Killer Missile on their tanks. Finally, all Shadowswords are equipped with Smoke Launchers to increase survivability and a Searchlight for night-fighting. ^^Like the Baneblade a “true” Shadowsword will have its own number and name and be registered on Mars, where all of its deeds shall be recorded regularly. So-called “counterfeit” Shadowswords are produced by Forge Worlds which don't have access to the same STC data and are consequently less advanced than those which have been properly constructed and consecrated: their logic engines and targeters will be more primitive, their capacitors or engine less efficient, their remote-controlled sponson weapons replaced with crewed versions, and the Volcano Cannon may be replaced with a large Plasma Cannon, a huge Battle Cannon or a Turbo Laser. ^^^One moment, a colossal enemy war engine tears its way across the battlefield, the Astra Militarum dying in droves beneath its guns. The next, a deafening shriek cuts the air as a ruby beam of light strikes the towering foe with incredible force. Bio-titans and Wraithknights alike crash to the ground with glowing tunnels blasted clean through their bodies. Enemy Titans explode with spectacular force, the flames of their demise lighting the battlefield for miles around. Even as the foe cries out in horror, the architect of this destruction is already powering up its engines and preparing to relocate. Rumbling from amid the ruins that concealed it, the Shadowsword sets out in search of its next target, its veteran crewmen adding another kill to their noble tank’s tally even as their previous victim smoulders in their wake."

descr "The Stormlord's primary armament is a Vulcan Mega-Bolter, which can dispatch enemy infantry with a vicious hail of fire. Although it may lack the heavier guns on its brethren, the Shadowsword or the Stormsword it is normally deployed alongside the Titan Hunters as “pest control”. Its massive amount of anti-infantry firepower is the bane of light troops everywhere, but its most widely regarded ability is troop transport, which its older counterparts are not equipped for. ^^The Stormlord's secondary armanent consists of two sponson-mounted Heavy Flamers/Heavy Bolters, two sponson-mounted Lascannons and a frontal Twin-linked Heavy Bolter. It is often equipped with the pintle-mounted Storm Bolter/Heavy Stubber and/or hunter-killer missile. Like the Shadowsword, it is always equipped with the Searchlight and Smoke Launchers. ^^The Stormlord is able to redirect the power normally supplied to the engine to double the Vulcan Mega-Bolter's rate of fire. ^^^Autoloaders clatter and ammo feeds whine as the Stormlord prepares to open fire. Barrels spin up to speed, the enemy given a split second to scream in terror as they realise their death is upon them. Then, with an unbelievable roar of fury, the Stormlord opens fire and sweeps all before it into red mist. Thousands of rounds per second tear infantry apart, hammer light tanks into perforated, sparking wreckage and mangle even the mightiest monstrous beasts. Adding to this hurricane of shot comes the fire of the Stormlord’s occupants, a whole platoon of Astra Militarum soldiery blazing away with lasguns and heavy weapons in support of their mobile fortress. Against this pounding fusillade, the foe can do little but fall back or die, ceding the field to the Stormlord and its victorious garrison."

descr "The Stormsword was originally a field conversion of a salvaged Shadowsword chassis; though such “unofficial” conversions are frowned upon by the conservative elements of the Adeptus Mechanicus, most Guard commanders take a more pragmatic view. In place of the Shadowsword's Volcano cannon is a large Hellhammer siege gun firing rocket-propelled siege shells. While sufficiently powerful to level an entire building with a single shot, typically by destroying the ground floor and collapsing the structure, the weapon's limited range and restricted elevation severely limits its utility on the open battlefield. ^^The Stormsword's formidable secondary armaments are also geared towards the close confines of a street brawl: a coaxial Heavy Bolter is supported by two sponson-mounted twin-linked Heavy Bolters atop which are turret-mounted Heavy Flamers. Although, some Stormswords replace their sponsons with extra armour plating. The Stormsword can also mount additional weapons such as a Hunter-Killer Missile and/or a pintle-mounted Heavy Stubber/Storm Bolter. ^^While it remains a rare vehicle, the Stormsword has earned its place within the Imperial Guard, leading the charge in the heart of intense city battles, and it is rumoured some Forge Worlds have begun producing them in limited numbers."

descr "The history of the Imperium is replete with heroic warriors – individuals whose noble deeds and sacrifice on the battlefield are the stuff of legends. Though the names of the vast majority are forgotten to the careless passage of time, occasionally a hero has arisen above obscurity to become idolised by the Imperium’s populace. A few of these heroes have even been declared saints, and great statues were raised in their honour. In the succeeding centuries, it was common for buildings to be built beside, or even around these statues, towering architectures constructed by the Ecclesiarchy to awe the pilgrims flocking daily to pay homage. ^^Millennia of war, however, have reduced many of these edifices to cratered ruins, artillery shells transforming marble sculpture to shattered rubble. Sometimes though, remnants of ancient statuary remain more or less intact amidst the devastation, their survival seen as a blessing from the Emperor. No citizen of the Imperium who looks upon these honoured monuments is not moved by their holy provenance, and soldiers fighting in the shadow of these memorials to the Emperor’s greatest heroes are inspired to near-insane levels of courage as they endeavour to emulate their legendary deeds."

descr "Barricades and walls are hastily assembled obstacles or the remains of once proud structures. Sandbags, trenches, razorwire, tank-traps and various other pieces of battlefield debris can slow or funnel the advance of enemy troops while protecting defenders. Though they cannot be relied upon to stop a determined assault such defences are often pivotal in protecting key locations."

descr "The Sentry Gun, more commonly referred to as a Tarantula, is an Imperial automated mobile weapon system based upon ancient Imperial technology. Useful in a variety of roles, it is most notably used by the Imperial Guard, but is also utilized by other groups including the Adeptus Astartes and the Adeptus Arbites. The exact origin for its nickname is unknown also it is fair to assume that their multi-legged appearance can be attributed in part to this. ^^It is said that some Veteran Guardsmen venerate this arcane devices that saved their life on more than one occasions. It is not unheard of for dedications to the sentry's gun machine spirit to be found reverentially placed around it. This practice is frowned upon by most Imperial commanders and Commissars have been known to issue severe penalties to anyone Guardsman caught participating in such acts of unsanctioned worship.^^The main Forge Worlds of Tarantula's origin are Lucius, M'khand, Voss and Metalica."

These bulwarks can withstand an impressive amount of firepower, but they typically lack automated weapons systems of their own. As such, they must be garrisoned to provide effective defence, yet – as many enemy commanders have learned to their cost – a single fire team protected behind a bunker’s walls can reap a disproportionately heavy toll on approaching forces. ^^Many Imperial Bunkers are built as forward observation posts and are often equipped with extensive vox units and comms arrays. Typically constructed on sites with commanding views, the better to monitor the movement of enemy units, these bunkers are especially valued by frontline Imperial Guard officers who prefer to issue orders, direct artillery strikes and coordinate troop deployments from the relative safety of an armoured fortification."

descr "An Imperial Bastion is an imposing edifice built from foot-thick ferrocrete and the remains of faithful servants of the Imperium. As they are relatively easy to construct, some planets boast networks of Bastions that span entire continents. Built to withstand orbital strikes and artillery bombardments, there are few weapons capable of razing them in a single blow. It is with good reason that such fortresses often form the cornerstone of a planet’s defensive strategy. ^^Bastions afford their defenders commanding fields of fire. A unit garrisoned within the protective walls can unleash murderous volleys with little fear of reprisal. Heavy bolters jut from a Bastion’s every wall, spitting death at any foes that dare approach. Only the most determined assault is likely to shift troops from such a fortification and few who brave an Imperial Bastion’s guns ever reach the walls alive."

# Macro-cannon Aquila Strongpoint #535pts
# Macro-cannon Aquila Strongpoints are massive fortifications, often used as bastions in Imperial defensive battle lines. Each consists of a munitions silo, topped by a large turret that houses the huge macro-cannon that gives the strongpoint its name. ^^The munitions silo allows the Aquila macro-cannon to fire special quake shells, each of which measures several feet in length and has a powerful charge that causes it to reach hyper-sonic velocity when it is fired.
# Composition: 1 main strongpoint and 1 bunker annex .
# Terrain Type: Multiple part building. The main strongpoint is a large building (Armour Value 15) with battlements.
# The bunker annex is a medium building (Armour Value 15) with battlements.
# Access Points & Fire Points: As per model.
# Weapons: The main strongpoint has one emplaced Aquila macro-cannon.
# Special Rules:
# Mighty Bulwark: When a building with the Mighty Bulwark special rule suffers a penetrating hit, there is a -1 modifier to the roll on the Building Damage table.
# Options:
# • May add up to four emplaced heavy bolters (these can be allocated to any part(s) of the fortification)....10 pts each
# • May take items from the Buildings and Obstacles lists.
# Aquila Macro-Cannon
# Macro shell 72" S-D Ap1 Primary Weapon 2, large blast
# Quake shell 180" S-10/7/5 AP 1/4/6 Primary Weapon 1, Apocalyptic Mega-Blast, Sonic Boom
# Sonic Boom : After firing a quake shell, draw a straight line between the Aquila macro-cannon and the central hole of the apocalyptic mega-blast template. Roll a dice for each Fly er, Flying Monstrous Creature, or Flying Gargantuan Creature model crossed by this line. On a roll of 1 , a Fly er will Crash and Burn, while a Flying Monstrous Creature or Flying Gargantuan Creature will take D3 Wounds with no saving throws allowed.

# Composition: 1 Wall of Martyrs Firestorm Redoubt.
# Terrain Type: Medium building (Armour Value 14) with battlements.
# Access Points & Fire Points: As per model.
# Weapons: Two emplaced quad Icarus lascannons.
# Special Rules:
# Fully Automated: Emplaced weapons on a Firestorm Redoubt can only fire using the automated fire rule: models occupying a Firestorm Redoubt cannot use the manual fire rule to fire any of its emplaced weapons.
# Primary Target: Emplaced weapons on a Firestorm Redoubt that have the Sky fire special rule must fire at the nearest enemy Flyer or Flying Monstrous Creature unit within range and line of sight. If no enemy unit of either of these types is within range or line of sight, that emplaced weapon must instead fire at the nearest enemy unit within range and line of sight.
# Very Wide Fire Point: Up to six occupying models can fire out of this building’s fire point.
# Options:
# • May take items from the Buildings, Obstacles and Battlements & Battlefield lists.
# • May replace any quad Icarus lascannon with:

# - Battle cannon....10 pts each

Armed with powerful cannons, they unleash deadly salvoes of fire on any enemies that approach them. ^^Countless billions of these batteries have been built over the course of the Imperium’s 1 0,000 year history and they remain a common sight on the battlefields of the 41 st Millennium. Each Vengeance Weapon Battery sports a powerful cannon in a rotating turret, which is controlled by a simple automated firing system which will fire on any enemy unit it can sense. The thick plascrete walls of the battery make it invulnerable to all but the most powerful of weapons. Such is their durability that a Vengeance Weapon Battery will often remain operational long after any flesh and blood defenders have been killed or fled the battlefield. ^^The batteries are usually constructed forward of the main defence line, where their automated fire can serve as advance warning of an attack while driving the enemy into carefully pre-selected killing zones. They are also often used as automated weapon sentries to protect important locations, freeing up more mobile troops to be used elsewhere. ^^Vengeance Weapon Batteries are easy to construct and extremely robust, known to operate effectively for hundreds of years without requiring maintenance. They are usually armed with either a battle cannon, capable of taking on heavily armoured targets, a punisher gatling cannon, capable of scything down entire units of infantry with a single volley, or a quad Icarus lascannon, punching aircraft out of the skies with every salvo."

# "The history of the Imperium is replete with heroic warriors – individuals whose noble deeds and sacrifice on the battlefield are the stuff of legends. Though the names of the vast majority are forgotten to the careless passage of time, occasionally a hero has arisen above obscurity to become idolised by the Imperium’s populace. A few of these heroes have even been declared saints, and great statues were raised in their honour. In the succeeding centuries, it was common for buildings to be built beside, or even around these statues, towering architectures constructed by the Ecclesiarchy to awe the pilgrims flocking daily to pay homage. ^^Millennia of war, however, have reduced many of these edifices to cratered ruins, artillery shells transforming marble sculpture to shattered rubble. Sometimes though, remnants of ancient statuary remain more or less intact amidst the devastation, their survival seen as a blessing from the Emperor. No citizen of the Imperium who looks upon these honoured monuments is not moved by their holy provenance, and soldiers fighting in the shadow of these memorials to the Emperor’s greatest heroes are inspired to near-insane levels of courage as they endeavour to emulate their legendary deeds."
# Composition: 1 Imperial Statue and 2 pieces of Imperial Rubble.
# Terrain Type: The Imperial Statue is battlefield debris (Imperial statuary ). Both pieces of Imperial Rubble are battlefield debris (rubble). The three pieces of battlefield debris must be placed wholly within 1 2" of each other.
# Weapons: None.
# Special Rules:
# Sacred Ground: All models from the armies of the Imperium (e.g. Imperial Guard, Sisters of Battle, all Chapters of Space Marines etc.) hav e the Stubborn special rule whilst within 2" of Imperial Rubble.

# Wall of Martyrs Imperial Defence Network
# "A Wall of Martyrs Imperial Defence Network often forms the lynchpin of an army’s defensive strategy and is typically built to protect key battlefield objectives. Comprising several armoured fortifications and interconnected by an arterial series of trenches, defence lines and weapon emplacements, it can take a fully equipped army several months of gruelling siege war to blast, bombard, dig and burn a truly determined opponent out from these defensive positions. ^^At its heart will be a single fortification, typically an Imperial Bunker, which acts as a command post for the entire defensive network. Typically equipped with extensive communications equipment, Imperial generals can utilise the bunker to coordinate the deployment of reinforcements to bolster any section of the network that is hard pressed by enemy attacks whilst simultaneously directing the firepower of heavy weapon emplacements to throw back and repulse the foe’s advance."
# Composition: Fortification Network consisting of:
# • 1 -3 Wall of Martyrs Imperial Bunkers.
# • 1 -4 Wall of Martyrs Imperial Defence Lines.
# • 1 -3 Wall of Martyrs Imperial Defence Emplacements.
# • 0-2 Wall of Martyrs Firestorm Redoubts.
# • 0-2 Wall of Martyrs Vengeance Weapons Battery .

# Skyshield Landing Pad
# Composition: 1 Sky shield Landing Pad.
# Terrain Type: Unusual. The top surface of the Sky shield Landing Pad is open ground. To mov e onto or off of the landing pad counts as mov ing through difficult terrain.
# Weapons: None.
# Special Rules:
# Landing Pad Configuration: A Sky shield Landing Pad has certain rules depending on its current configuration, shielded or unfurled, as described below. At the beginning of the Mov ement phase, before rolling for Reserv es, a model in base contact with a Sky shield Landing Pad can change its configuration from shielded to unfurled (or vice versa). If there are models from both sides in base contact with the landing pad, its configuration cannot be changed.
# • Shielded: Units on top of a shielded Sky shield Landing Pad have a 4+ invulnerable save against shooting attacks.
# • Unfurled: If a unit deep strikes on top of an unfurled Sky shield Landing Pad, it will never scatter. Jump units, Jet Pack units, Jetbikes and Skimmers do not need to take Dangerous Terrain tests for moving on to or off of an unfurled Sky shield Landing Pad.
# Options:
# • May take items from the Obstacles list.
# • May upgrade to hav e the Ready for Takeoff special rule....5 pts
# Upgrade:
# Ready for Takeoff: A Sky shield Landing Pad can be upgraded to have this special rule. When deploying your army, you can deploy one of your Flyers with the Hover type on top of each of your Sky shield Landing Pads that has this upgrade, even though Flyers normally have to start the game in reserves. Flyers that deploy in this way start the game hovering and cannot Zoom in the first game turn.

descr "Landing pads are used to protect aircraft as they unload supplies or evacuate troops to or from the front lines. The Skyshield Landing Pad used by the Imperial Navy was originally purpose-built to accommodate Valkyrie and Vendetta gunships. However, it has proven robust enough to serve the larger Stormravens and Thunderhawks used by the Adeptus Astartes. With its armoured sides unfurled, Skyshields activate a series of locator beacons that guide incoming aircraft as they make their final approach. Once the craft touches down, the Skyshield’s armour plating transforms into a protective configuration and force field generators shimmer to life, protecting the vulnerable gunship from incoming fire as it refuels, rearms or deploys its passengers."

The Munitorum has ultimate responsibility for the raising of new regiments, training of troops, provision of equipment and supplies, and transportation of troops and equipment to and from theatres of war. It is primarily a logistical organisation, like the Administratum, but while the Administratum deals with civilian logistics, the Munitorum deals with the logistics of war. Using military as opposed to civilian ranks, the Departmento Munitorum dates back to the Great Crusade."

The Wall of Martyrs Defence Line is very often the first line of defence, a proud bulwark that can be used to resist the onslaught of such foes. ^^The bleached bones of long-dead warriors of the Imperium are literally built into the foundations of Wall of Martyrs Defence Lines, and the thrice-blessed blood of saintly heroes is often used by members of the Ecclesiarchy to sanctify their armoured shields. No wonder, then, that when the soldiers of the Imperium stand within these hallowed defence lines, their hearts are steeled against the worst horrors of the galaxy. So infused with righteousness, these troops stalwartly refuse to take a single step back whilst the Emperor’s enemies remain.
# Composition: Up to 2 Wall of Martyrs Imperial Defence Line sections and up to 4 Imperial Defence Line end sections. Each section of defence line must be placed in contact with at least one other section.
# Terrain Type: Battlefield debris (defence lines).
# Weapons: None.
# Special Rules:
# Stalwart Defence: Models have the Stubborn special rule whilst within a Wall of Martyrs Imperial Defence Line or Defence Emplacement section.
# Options:
# • May take items from the Obstacles list.

# Wall of Martyrs Imperial Defence Emplacement #40pts
# Wall of Martyrs Imperial Defence Emplacements are constructed using the same hallowed materials as the Wall of Martyrs Defence Lines, but are built to accommodate infantry teams manning heavy weaponry in support of their battlefield comrades. ^^With a large armoured firing port overlooking a wide angle of approach, no foe can hope to charge a manned defence emplacement without being cut down by a hail of clattering autocannon and heavy bolter fire.
# Composition: Up to 3 Wall of Marty rs Imperial Defence Emplacement sections and up to 2 Imperial Defence Line end sections. Each section must be placed in contact with at least one other section.
# Terrain Type: Battlefield debris (defence lines).
# Weapons: None.
# Special Rules:
# Improved Arc of Fire: Any model within a Defence Emplacement section re-rolls failed To Hit rolls when resolving Overwatch if using a weapon with the Heavy type.
# Stalwart Defence: Models have the Stubborn special rule whilst within a Wall of Martyrs Imperial Defence Line or Defence Emplacement section.
# Options:
# • May take items from the Obstacles list.


# Fortress of Redemption #220pts
# "A Fortress of Redemption is a towering bulwark against the ravages of planetary invasion. Each is virtually impervious to conventional firepower and the lower levels, bunker annexes and sub-crypts can house entire platoons of battle-ready warriors. First used by the Dark Angels Legion during the days of the Great Crusade, they have since been used by every military force in the Imperium and proven invaluable to its defence. ^^A Fortress of Redemption is adorned with symbols depicting angels of death and the skulls of ancient heroes. This gothic grandeur of the unyielding edifice is matched only by its uncompromising and efficient lethality. Nestled within its armoured walls, a Fortress of Redemption houses an Icarus lascannon capable of destroying enemy ships in low orbit, a missile silo and a profusion of heavy bolters to repel ground based invaders."
# Composition: 1 main tower, 2 bunker annexes and 1 connecting walkway .
# Terrain Type: Multiple part building. The main tower is a medium building (Armour Value 14) with battlements.
# The bunker annexes are both small buildings (Armour Value 14) with battlements. The connecting walkway is a small building (Armour Value 14) with battlements.
# Access Points & Fire Points: As per model.
# Weapons: One bunker annex has an emplaced missile silo with fragstorm missiles and the other bunker annex has an emplaced twin Icarus lascannon.
# Options:
# • May take items from the Buildings and Obstacles lists.
# • May upgrade the Fortress of Redemption to have the Remote Fire special rule....10 pts
# • May upgrade the missile silo to have krakstorm missiles in addition to fragstorm missiles....30 pts
# • May add up to four emplaced heavy bolters (these can be allocated to any section(s) of the fortification)....10 pts each
# Upgrade:
# Remote Fire: A Fortress of Redemption can be upgraded to have this special rule. If so, any of the fortification’s emplaced weapons can be fired (using either automated or manual fire) by models occupy ing the main tower, even if the building housing the emplaced weapons itself is unoccupied. This rule cannot be used to fire emplaced weapons on any part of the fortification occupied by an enemy unit.

# Vortex Missile Aquila Strongpoint #535pts
# "One of the most devastating and dreaded weapons in the Imperium’s vast armoury is the vortex missile. A Vortex Missile Strongpoint houses several of the fearsomely destructive warheads and is filled with complex targeting arrays to guide each vortex missile to its unfortunate target. When the missile strikes down, a large void is torn in the fabric of space-time, creating a swirling maelstrom that utterly destroys anything that lies within its radius of effect."
# Composition: 1 main strongpoint and 1 bunker annex .
# Terrain Type: Multiple part building. The main strongpoint is a large building (Armour Value 15) with battlements.
# The bunker annex is a medium building (Armour Value 15) with battlements.
# Access Points & Fire Points: As per model.
# Weapons: The main strongpoint has one emplaced vortex missile battery .
# Special Rules:
# Mighty Bulwark: When a building with the Mighty Bulwark special rule suffers a penetrating hit, there is a -1 modifier to the roll on the Building Damage table.
# Missile Battery : The emplaced vortex missile battery may fire a max imum of sev en vortex missiles ov er the course of the battle. No more than one missile may be fired per Shooting phase.
# Containment Failure: If the main strongpoint suffers a Total Collapse or Detonation! result, roll one dice for each remaining vortex missile. On a roll of 1-2, the missile explodes. Place the vortex’s blast marker on the centre of the main strongpoint, and then scatter it 2D6".
# Options:
# • May add up to four emplaced heavy bolters (these can be allocated to any part(s) of the fortification)....10 pts each
# • May take items from the Buildings and Obstacles lists.

setclassname	"Astra Militarum"
classdescr "The Imperial Guard, also known as the Astra Militarum in traditional High Gothic, is the largest coherent fighting force in the galaxy. They serve as the Imperium of Man's primary combat force and first line of defence from the myriad threats which threaten the existence of the human race in the late 41st Millennium. It is comprised of countless billions of men and women -- hundreds of thousands of different regiments, supported by a vast array of light and heavy armoured vehicles that provide the Guard's primary offensive punch. They are usually the first Imperial force to respond to a threat if a planet's Planetary Defence Force (PDF) fails to suppress it. They also garrison major locations of strategic or cultural interest to the Imperium and are often found in defensive roles.  ^^The Imperial Guard is often referred to as the “Sledgehammer of the Emperor”; the sheer amount of force that the Imperial Guard can bring to bear on the enemy is devastating, but is not as direct or as precise as their Space Marine allies, who are described as the “Scalpel of the Emperor.” There is no universal uniform or regimental command hierarchy in the Imperial Guard, although it is compulsory for every regiment to have at least one Commissar to maintain the discipline and morale of the men while watching for any signs of corruption or taint in the ranks. However, it is worth noting that a number of worlds copy the uniform used by the regiments of the Cadian Shock Troops, who are viewed as being the most effective of the Imperial Guard's infantry units. The main tactic of the Imperial Guard is to overwhelm the enemy with their endless numbers, while at the same time hammer them into submission with devastating artillery and crush them with powerful main battle tanks.  ^^   “Men, we are the first, last and often only line of defence the Imperium has against what is out there. You and that fine piece of Imperial weaponry you hold in your hands is all that is keeping humanity alive. Most of you will probably not live to see your second year in the Guard and most of you will probably never see your homeworlds again, but I can guarantee you that when you do fall, with a prayer to the most high and mighty God-Emperor on your lips, you will have earned the right to call yourself a man!”  ^^———Staff Sergeant Vermak, 12th Cadian Shock Regiment"
