description 	"v1.308 of Tyranid faction by FnF. Using 7th edition units and stats converted with some modifications to fit CoE4. Enjoy"

# -------------------------  Rules for Converting 40k to CoE4 -------------------------
# The Tyranids have many special rules. I have modified these rules to fit CoE4 as follows:

# Damage = WS for melee weapon modifier, S for weapon damage, BS for ranged weapon modifier
# WS modifier = (WS-4) + (Attacks-2) = Final WS modifier

#Basic Stats:
#hp = T x Wounds x 3 (+6 for leaders) 
#mr = Ld/2 (+ 1 for leaders) (+3 for psykers) (+3 for shadow in the warp) 
#str = S
#armor = Toughness -2 or Armour save, whichever is higher: 
#						Sv-=0 Sv6+=0 Sv5+=1 Sv4+=2 Sv3+=3 Sv2+=4 Sv1+=5
# Sv2+ or better gains pierce/slash/blunt res.
#mor = ld/2 (/2 for Lurk troops)
#rank = 0 #mid for ranged, 1 #melee for assault, -1 #rear for leaders
#meleeweapon <WS -4> "weapon name"
#meleeweaponlong <WS -4> "weapon" for lances/powerswords/whips
#rangedweapon50 <BS -4> "weapon" for pistols
#assassinweapon <dmg> "weapon name" for sniper rifles or stealthy unit weapons
#siegeweapon <dmg> "weapon name" for Heavy weapons 3+

# Instinctive Behaviours:
# Lurk gain low morale (mor /2)
# Hunt gain Standard morale (mor = Ld/2) 
# Feed gain berserker

# Shadow in the Warp = mr + 3

# Synapse Creatures:
#localleadership 4 #Morale bonus at short range
#gatherherbs #for summoning stupid units
#gatherfungus #for summoning troops
#gatherweed #for summoning leaders / spell mastery / unit upgrades
#and are commanders, "c*" for summoning

# Extra Rules:
# Summoning numbers:
# 2 #Herbs
# 3 #Fungi
# 6 #Weed
# Units can come in three forms: Stupid-herbs, Normal-fungus and commander-weed

# Stupid units/versions of units: (Swarms, Mines, Troops)
# 2 #Herbs 
# stupid #cannot be controlled 
# eatdead 50 #<chance> for swarms
# eatdeadcap 30 #<%chance> for some standard units, capped at 1/square
# eatdeadcap 5 #<%chance> for some elite/large units, capped at 1/square
# Unit pts cost converted into herb cost 1:1

# ---- Standard Units ----
# 3 #Fungi
# Unit pts cost converted into fungi cost 1:1

# ---- Leader / HQ Units ----
# 6 #Weed
# Unit pts cost converted into weed cost 1:1

# absorbdead <corpses>
# Sets the number of corpses he monster absorbs from the square it is located at each month.  
# Absorbed corpses increase the monster’s HP toward the maximum possible.  If the monster 
# also has the hpoverflow ability, the HP can increase over the monster’s normal maximum

# ------------------------------ Tyranid Glossary ------------------------------
# Acid blood +poisonexpl 5
# Adaptive Biology +berserk
# Adrenal glands +fast
# Alien Cunning -no effect
# Alpha Leader +leadership
# Alpha Warrior -no effect
# Armourbane +AN
# Assault -remove rangepen from weapon
# Fearless =mor 15 + berserker
# Feeder-beast +absorbdead 5 and hpoverflow 1
# Feel No Pain/Monstrous Creature/Character +pierce/slash/blunt resistances
# Fleet +fast
# Fleshbane +poison
# Terror From the Deep +tunnel
# Toxic Miasma +poisoncloud 3 #(Value = Radius +1)
# Warp Field +nonmaginvul

# Powers of the Hive mind
# Primaris Power
# Dominion - Warp Charge 1
# The Tyranid uses its prodigious psychic strength to channel and amplify the will of the Hive Mind.
# Dominion is a blessing that targets the Psyker. Whilst this power is in effect the Psyker adds 6" to its synapse range.

# 1. Catalyst - Warp Charge 1
# Through its synaptic conduits, the power of the Hive Mind reaches out to infuse the organisms under its control, invigorating their systems with such unnatural vitality that they can ignore the most grievous of wounds.
# Catalyst is a blessing that targets the Psyker’s unit and up to one other friendly unit from Codex: Tyranids that is within 12". Whilst this power is in effect, the targets gain the Feel No Pain special rule.

# 2. The Horror - Warp Charge 1
# The terrifying psychic presence of the Hive Mind radiates from the synapse creature, flooding the minds of the Tyranids’ enemies and causing them to quail and panic.
# The Horror is a malediction that targets a single enemy unit within 24”. The target must immediately take a Pinning test (as described for the Pinning special rule in the Warhammer 40,000 rulebook) with a -2 modifier to their Leadership.
# Fear 1-10 dmg vs morale, mr negates with great difficulty, an, aoe 1, range 8
# Terror 1-8 dmg vs morale, mr negates with great difficulty, an, aoe burst 25, range 10
# Nightmares 1-7 dmg vs morale, mr negates easily, an, aoe burst 100, range 10 

# 3. Onslaught - Warp Charge 1
# The synapse creature reaches out its mind and seizes control of the lesser creatures’ weapon symbiotes, guiding their fire whilst simultaneously driving the swarms towards the enemy at a breakneck pace.
# Onslaught is a blessing that targets a single friendly unit within 24". Whilst this power is in effect, the target unit can both Run and then shoot in its Shooting phase.

# 4. Paroxysm - Warp Charge 1
# The Hive Mind debilitates its enemies by triggering every nerve and pain receptor in their bodies, overwhelming their senses with wracking fits of agony.
# Paroxysm is a malediction that targets a single enemy unit within 24". Whilst this power is in effect, the target unit’s Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill are both reduced by D3 (roll once and apply the result to both characteristics).

# 5. Psychic Scream - Warp Charge 1
# Through its vassal, the Hive Mind unleashes a piercing shriek of undiluted psychic energy that shreds the minds of those caught in the wake.
# Psychic Scream is a nova power with a range of 6". For each target unit, roll 2D6+2 and subtract their Leadership. That unit suffers a number of Wounds equal to the result. Armour and cover saves cannot be taken against Wounds caused by Psychic Scream.

# 6. Warp Blast - Warp Charge 2
# The Tyranid taps into the raw power of the Hive Mind, unleashing it as a blast of pure Warp energy that arcs from its cranium and vaporises its prey.
# Warp Blast is a witchfire power. Warp Blast can be used as either a Burst or a Lance. Each time this power is manifested, the controlling player must choose which profile is being used, before the target is chosen:

#Mastery level 1

spr2 "w40kmod/tyranid_3x3_hive_tyrant1.tga"
descr "Hive Tyrants are the commanders of the Tyranid swarms and enact the Hive Mind’s will on the field of battle. Though individuals display a wide variety of physical characteristics, all Hive Tyrants are fearsome hulking monsters that tower over even a Dreadnought. They are brutally strong, able to shatter ferrocrete with sickening ease. Every part of such a beast’s body is perfectly created to kill, even the layers of chitinous plating that protect them. A Hive Tyrant is a formidable opponent at any distance, as deadly with ranged weapons as it is with bonesword or claw. Hive Tyrants embody the Tyranid Hive Mind completely, but their destruction does not in any way diminish it. Death is simply another learning experience that gives insight to the prey’s strengths and weaknesses. This goes some way to explain why the Tyranids can rarely be defeated the same way twice. Should a Hive Tyrant be slain on the battlefield, the Hive Mind simply grows a replacement, imbuing it with the same knowledge as its predecessor. Fortunately for the rest of the galaxy, this does not lead to infallibility of purpose. Even the most fearsome Hive Tyrant cannot anticipate its prey’s every ploy, nor can it oversee every quarter of the battlefield. However, the Hive Mind’s capacity to regrow its fallen leaders does render each Hive Tyrant practically immortal. No matter how many times a Hive Tyrant is killed, sooner or later it will always come back to overcome and devour its prey."

This creature is to a Hive Tyrant what a Hive Tyrant is to a Termagant. It is a monster of darkest nightmare that has preyed on empires and overseen the extinction of entire civilisations.

spr2 "w40kmod/tyranid_3x3_old_one_eye1.tga"
descr "The Carnifex known as Old One Eye is a monster of living legend. When Hive Fleet Behemoth descended upon the cavern world of Calth, Old One Eye spearheaded the Tyranid assault. Stampeding through the defenders, it swatted aside Imperial Guardsmen and Leman Russ Battle Tanks as if they were naught but bothersome insects. Only the most powerful of weaponry slowed the beast down and, to this day, its body bears the scars of the many blows that should by all rights have killed it. Foremost amongst these is a deep burn running across its armoured skull, a testament to the courage of a long-forgotten hero of the Imperium who fired a plasma pistol through one of the beast’s eyes and into its brain. It was this very shot that brought the Carnifex’s rampage to a dramatic halt, the first time such a feat had ever occurred. ^^The legend of Old One Eye might have ended there had it not been for a band of smugglers who stumbled across the monster’s frozen body decades later. Hoping to reap a bounty for the corpse, they thawed the Carnifex out, but even as they did so, its grievous wounds began to heal. Isolated from the guiding presence of the Hive Mind, Old One Eye awoke with only the need to kill. Its one remaining eye gazed hungrily upon the unsuspecting smugglers who barely had time to register the beast was alive before they were slaughtered. Released from its icy prison, Old One Eye roamed across the blizzard-swept landscape of Calth in search of more prey. Like much of the Ultramar system at this time, Termagants and Genestealers still lurked within caves there, despite Hive Fleet Behemoth’s defeat. These creatures were drawn to Old One Eye, sensing in the Carnifex a powerful alpha leader. All over the planet, land convoys were destroyed, hab-domes smashed and entire populations massacred and devoured. ^^Calth’s cries for help did not go unheeded; Sergeant Telion of the Ultramarines, a veteran of the First Tyrannic War, answered them. It did not take the Scout Sergeant long to track his quarry, but neither bolt shell nor knifeblade could pierce Old One Eye’s armoured hide. As Telion’s warriors were crushed to a pulp beneath the Carnifex’s massive claws, the Sergeant somehow managed a one-in-a-million shot that found the pit of its ruined eye-socket. The mighty Carnifex howled in pain and, in its frenzied rage, stumbled into a cavernous ravine. Though Telion led a week-long search for the beast’s body, it was never found. Since that time, there have been scattered reports of Old One Eye re-emerging to wreak havoc, only to be felled through the actions of a bold hero. Indeed, if all the tales are true, Old One Eye has been slain more than a dozen times, but at great cost on each occasion. None know of Old One Eye’s true fate; there are those that believe the creature is long dead and that the tales of its return are mere stories to frighten disobedient children. ^^However, rumours persist that creatures matching Old One Eye’s description have been seen plaguing planets across Ultramar and beyond. If this is the same creature, it is unknown how it escaped the confines of Calth, but the fact remains that, wherever Old One Eye is sighted, carnage and slaughter follow in its wake."

spr2 "w40kmod/tyranid_3x3_tervigon1.tga"
descr "The Tervigon is a massive synapse creature whose towering carapace shields a swollen abdomen. Though possessed of a formidable array of bio-weapons, from monstrous claws that crush any prey that ventures too close, to banks of razor-tipped spines that can be fired a considerable distance, the Tervigon’s true threat lies within... Every Tervigon serves as a living incubator, within whose bloated form dozens upon dozens of Termagants slumber in a state of near-life. The Tervigon can spawn its dormant broods at will, jolting their minds into wakefulness. So it is that a foe engaging a Tervigon up close will find itself assailed by waves of skittering Termagants. Such a confrontation is terrible to behold, for a Tervigon’s capacity to reinforce is vast, and its broods are driven into a near-frenzy by the need to protect their progenitor. The only way for a cool-headed enemy commander to end the horror is to have his troops concentrate all their firepower on the Tervigon. If the beast is slain, the resultant synaptic backlash may kill many of its young. Such a tactic is easier said than done, for the firepower needed to fell a Tervigon is comparable to that needed to demolish a heavily armoured battle fortress. When a hive fleet travels through space, Tervigons do not slumber in a dormant state like the majority of other Tyranids. Instead, they roam the ship’s cavernous innards. Should a Tervigon detect intruders, it immediately spawns a veritable army of Termagants to repulse the foe whilst using its potent synaptic powers to hamper the enemy further or else awaken additional warriors. Unless the foe can act quickly, they will quickly be engulfed and overwhelmed beneath a tide of drooling jaws and serrated claws."

spr2 "w40kmod/tyranid_2x2_warrior_prime1.tga"
descr "Tyranid Primes are the apex of the Tyranid Warrior strain, faster, stronger and smarter than the other Warriors they lead to battle, who instinctively emulate their deadly skill. Tyranid Warriors are the most adaptable of all the Hive Mind’s bioforms. They are creatures from the blackest of nightmares, unstoppable killing machines with pulsing ichor for blood, needle-sharp teeth and darkly gleaming eyes that reveal a terrible intelligence at work. A Tyranid Warrior stands twice the height of a man, its carapace protected by a thick chitin. One might expect such a creature to be slow in its actions, but a Tyranid Warrior is lithe, with reactions as swift as a whip. Tyranid Warriors have the mental flexibility to employ a wide variety of bio-weapon symbiotes. As such, on the battlefield, they can be found leading all areas of a Tyranid swarm: fighting in close quarters with claws, boneswords and lash whips, or at longer ranges with devourers, deathspitters or even heavier bio-cannons. Whatever weaponry it wields, a Tyranid Warrior is a dangerous and unforgiving foe, able to identify and exploit the weaknesses of its targets with innate shrewdness. Worse, with its alien consciousness permanently bonded to the ageless Hive Mind, a Tyranid Warrior can instantly draw upon a reservoir of knowledge and experience that spans epochs, should its own prove insufficient to the task at hand."

descr "Tyranid Warriors are the most adaptable of all the Hive Mind’s bioforms. They are creatures from the blackest of nightmares, unstoppable killing machines with pulsing ichor for blood, needle-sharp teeth and darkly gleaming eyes that reveal a terrible intelligence at work. A Tyranid Warrior stands twice the height of a man, its carapace protected by a thick chitin. One might expect such a creature to be slow in its actions, but a Tyranid Warrior is lithe, with reactions as swift as a whip. Tyranid Warriors have the mental flexibility to employ a wide variety of bio-weapon symbiotes. As such, on the battlefield, they can be found leading all areas of a Tyranid swarm: fighting in close quarters with claws, boneswords and lash whips, or at longer ranges with devourers, deathspitters or even heavier bio-cannons. Whatever weaponry it wields, a Tyranid Warrior is a dangerous and unforgiving foe, able to identify and exploit the weaknesses of its targets with innate shrewdness. Worse, with its alien consciousness permanently bonded to the ageless Hive Mind, a Tyranid Warrior can instantly draw upon a reservoir of knowledge and experience that spans epochs, should its own prove insufficient to the task at hand."

descr "There are many terrifying creatures in the Tyranid hive fleets, but one in particular has carved out a horrifying and bloody legend on more than a thousand worlds. It is a lurker in dark places, a clawed harbinger of sudden death. It is known as the Genestealer, and it is a plague upon the galaxy. A Genestealer is a swift and powerful predator with lightning-fast reflexes and serrated claws that can tear through even the thickest of armour. Genestealers also have large, highly adaptive brains and possess a form of brood telepathy that allows them to function with full independence from the Hive Mind. This autonomy allows them to destroy through stealth and guile that which cannot be defeated through numbers alone. A strong survival instinct drives Genestealers outwards from the hive fleets, and they seek out space-bound vessels attempting to flee the surface of doomed prey-worlds. It is simple for a Genestealer to stow away aboard such ships, nesting unseen amongst crawl-spaces until it is brought to a new planet by the unsuspecting crew. If a single Genestealer reaches an inhabited world, it can spell disaster. Genestealers reproduce by implanting other life forms with their own genetic material. Once infected, a victim is enthralled by the Genestealers’ nascent telepathy and Tyranid attributes are passed on to its offspring, creating monstrous hybrids completely under the alien’s domination. These deformities eventually breed true, creating ‘purestrain’ Genestealers under the control of a Broodlord – the strongest and most dangerous of their kind. These Genestealers seem content to lurk in sewers and caves beneath cities, preying on the populace like folktale monsters until the Hive Mind’s will once again dominates their minds. No one knows how widespread the Genestealer infestation has become or how many worlds if affects. For every brood uncovered and purged, a dozen go unnoticed. When a Tyranid hive fleet enters an infested system, the Hive Mind asserts its synaptic dominion over the Broodlord and its clan. Planetary defenders are thrown into disarray as Genestealers suddenly burst from the shadows, overwhelming crucial systems and leaving the prey world vulnerable before the merciless Tyranid onslaught."

descr "Hormagaunts are vicious and extraordinarily single-minded predators that will pursue their victims without pause or respite. With powerful hind legs, Hormagaunts dart across the battlefield in a series of bounding leaps, ignoring injury and tiredness until they have run down their exhausted quarry and torn it apart with frenzied strikes of their scythe-like claws. Hormagaunts have fearsome hunting instincts and require little direction from the Hive Mind to seek out and slaughter prey. Indeed, once the Tyranid assault begins, they are mostly left to their own devices. On occasion, however, the Hive Mind will make contact with a brood’s quicksilver consciousness, spurring it towards a more distant or strategically important foe."

spr1 "w40kmod/tyranid_ripper_swarm1.tga"
spr2 "w40kmod/tyranid_ripper_swarm1.tga"
descr "A Ripper Swarm is a writhing mat of maggot-like Tyranid organisms driven by a single voracious appetite. Each Ripper is little more than an armoured serpent, terminating in a broad maw crammed with needle-sharp teeth. They are persistent beings, quite capable of pulling down creatures many times their size. Once a Ripper’s jaws tighten around its prey, they stay clamped shut until a mouthful of flesh is torn away or the Ripper is slain. On the rare occasions when the Rippers discover an obstacle that cannot be chewed through, they burrow beneath the obstruction, guided towards the prey by ferocious feeding instincts. They writhe across the surface, their numbers ever growing as they consume everything in their path. Ripper organisms follow hard on the heels of the Tyranid advance, devouring the dead and wounded with grim efficiency and boundless vigour. When sated, they throw their own engorged bodies into large digestion pools where they, and the biomass they have feasted upon, are broken down into a thick gruel used to feed the orbiting bioships and eventually create more complex creatures."

spr2 "w40kmod/tyranid_2x2_tyrant_guard1.tga"
descr "Tyrant Guard are the ultimate bodyguards; it is the entire purpose of their creation. Their instincts tend not towards self-preservation, but to the defence of the Hive Tyrant to which they are bonded. Should the Hive Tyrant come under attack, its Tyrant Guard move into the path of incoming fire without thought or concern, sheltering their charge with their own bodies. Tyrant Guard, therefore, take the form of colossal living shields. They are all but impervious to small-arms fire, and should heavy weaponry be brought to bear, several salvoes are required to fell even one of these beasts. These creatures have an incredible resistance to injury and are only dimly aware of pain, shrugging off wounds that would blow a man apart. Should their charge be slain, the Tyrant Guard will go berserk, lashing out and tearing at the enemy with brutal ferocity and savage abandon. A Tyrant Guard’s rampage is not guided by grief, nor a sense of neglected duty, for such things are alien concepts to the Tyranids. Rather, a Tyrant Guard’s reaction is pure instinct and part of the coldly calculated strategy of the Hive Mind. Hive Tyrants are vital to the Tyranid onslaught, and if the enemy finds a way to bring such a beast down, the Hive Mind does not want knowledge of how the feat was accomplished to survive the battle and be passed on to a future foe."

spr2 "w40kmod/tyranid_2x2_hive_guard1.tga"
descr "In the later stages of a Tyranid invasion, strange alien architecture begins to blight the prey world. Towering spore chimneys burst from beneath the churned ground to belch their poisonous spores into the air, and capillary towers are grown to funnel the digested gruel of the planet’s biomass up to the Hive Ships waiting in space. Such structures are vital to the Tyranids’ attempt to consume a world, and the Hive Mind has created a specific beast for their protection – the Hive Guard. Hive Guard are heavily armoured gun-beasts bound to extremely powerful symbiotic bio-weapons. Though they have no eyes, Hive Guard possess a weak telepathic ability that allows them to perceive through the senses of other Tyranids, giving them access to a wealth of targeting information that would overwhelm even the most sophisticated technological cogitator. The scant mental capacity apportioned to the Hive Guard means that, without the direction of the Hive Mind, they have been known to stand motionless, waiting for prey to come within range instead of moving forwards to engage."

descr "Zoanthropes are created solely to harness the psychic potential of the Hive Mind, and their entire bodies are perfected towards such a function. If necessary, a Zoanthrope can be used to extend the range of the Hive Mind’s synaptic control, utilising the beast’s vast cerebral capacity to relay its instructions to lesser creatures. Under these circumstances, the Zoanthrope is little more than a highly sophisticated messenger, but this is only a fraction of what their alien minds are capable of. A Zoanthrope’s link to the synaptic web is such that, by flexing the merest part of its mind, it can rain incandescent power on the enemy, projecting destructive bolts of energy that boils through adamantium plate and disintegrates flesh with equal ease. Zoanthropes are vital nodes for harnessing the Hive Mind’s psychic might and are created with a powerful sense of self-preservation. Therefore, they instinctively project a potent Warp field to protect themselves in battle – a mental shield that is invisible but for a slight shimmer when small-arms and heavy-weapons fire alike patters harmlessly against it. However, Zoanthropes are still predators, capable of eliminating any perceived threat with bolts of flaming psychic energy."

Zoanthropes are vital nodes for harnessing the Hive Mind’s psychic might and are created with a powerful sense of self-preservation. Therefore, they instinctively project a potent Warp field to protect themselves in battle – a mental shield that is invisible but for a slight shimmer when small-arms and heavy-weapons fire alike patters harmlessly against it. However, Zoanthropes are still predators, capable of eliminating any perceived threat with bolts of flaming psychic energy."

# WEAPONS & BIOMORPHS:

# SPECIAL RULES:
# • Psyker (Mastery Level 2)
# • Shadow in the Warp
# • Synapse Creature
# Psychic Barrier: A model with this special rule has a 5+ invulnerable save.
# PSYCHIC POWERS:
# A Maleceptor always knows the Psychic Overload psychic power. A Maleceptor
# generates its remaining powers from the Powers of the Hive Mind.
# Psychic Overload ...........................................Warp Charge 2
# The psyker plunges tendrils of psychic energy into the target’s brain,
# causing it to explode!
# Psychic Overload is a focussed witchfire power with a range
# of 24". The target must take a Leadership test on 3D6.
# Vehicles are treated as having a Leadership of 10. If the
# test is failed, non-vehicle models suffer D3 Wounds with no
# armour or cover saves allowed, and vehicle models suffer a
# single glancing hit with no cover saves allowed.
# The Psyker can attempt to manifest this psychic power
# up to 3 times in each of its Psychic phases. Each attempt
# is resolved separately. However, an enemy unit cannot be
# selected as the target of Psychic Overload manifested by the
# same Psyker more than once each Psychic phase.

descr "The Maleceptor is a living vessel for the Hive Mind. Warp energy spears from its eyeless cranium to vaporise anything in its path, and those with minds strong enough to survive its keening psychic screams are laid low by its powerful talons. Even in defence the creature is a potent foe, for its sixfold mind-nodes generate a psychic barrier that consumes the bullets and energy blasts sent to slay it. These brain-arrays also fulfil another, more sinister role. The ethereal pseudopods that snake out from the Maleceptor’s glistening lobes are best described as the Shadow in the Warp made manifest. Should one of these ectoplasmic tendrils so much as brush against an enemy, the psychic immensity of the Hive Mind will invade the victim’s brain, overloading it with such catastrophic force that its head explodes."

newmonster "Venomthrope"
spr1 "w40kmod/tyranid_2x2_venomthrope1.tga"
spr2 "w40kmod/tyranid_2x2_venomthrope1.tga"
descr "Venomthropes are gangrel creatures with scrawny bodies and whip-like tentacles that drip with alien poisons. Their carapaces house bulging, gas-filled bladders, allowing the Venomthropes to float ponderously across the battlefield, using their clusters of tendrils to steer themselves towards suitable prey. In addition to providing the Venomthropes’ mobility, the gas bladders also produce thick clouds of alien spores. Venomthropes are shrouded in a dense fog of these airborne spores that conceals not only them, but any other broods of Tyranid predators advancing in their wake. The spores are also the Venomthropes’ most insidious form of attack, for they are extremely poisonous to non-Tyranid life forms. Brief exposure causes violent bouts of nausea and uncontrollable muscle spasms, leaving foes weakened and easy prey for the nearby Tyranids. If the enemy is unfortunate, or foolish enough to inhale the Venomthropes’ emissions for any prolonged period, the alien spores will gain a foothold within the foe’s body. Reproducing rapidly, they spread throughout the host’s system, breaking down organic tissues at a horrifying rate. The victim ultimately drowns in its own frothing and infected bodily fluids, and as the diseased corpse collapses in on itself, the Venomthrope uses its feeder tendrils to suck up the bubbling remains. The bodies of Venomthropes are coated in a variety of alien poisons, but it is their writhing tentacles that exude the most lethal of all Tyranid toxins. These venoms are so virulent that on contact, they cause the flesh of their prey to wither and slough from bone. Those victims that do not succumb immediately are entangled by the writhing limbs, bound in a poisonous embrace until the Venomthropes toxic spores do their gruesome work. Though Venomthropes are not the most physically imposing or aggressive Tyranid bioforms, they are, if anything, more dangerous to a prey world’s continued survival than hordes of warrior organisms. Left to their own devices, a single brood of Venomthropes will eventually poison not only the entire world’s indigenous life, but also its soil and atmosphere, leaving the plague-shrouded planet fit only for consumption by the hive fleet."

descr "The Lictor is a highly specialised development of the Tyranid Warrior bioform, specifically adapted to fill a scout role in the vanguard of the Tyranid advance. Lictors rove ahead of the main body of a swarm, seeking out pockets of resistance to be eradicated and native life forms to be absorbed. Able to move swiftly and without sound through even the densest terrain, and concealed by a chameleonic carapace that renders it all but invisible to the naked eye, a Lictor can remain hidden until it chooses to strike. It can wait motionless for days, unnoticed by its victims, an unseen herald of approaching disaster. Lictors are not instinctively aggressive, as they are created primarily to locate prey for the wider swarm. Lictors are opportunistic hunters and therefore tend to stalk their quarry from the shadows, avoiding confrontations where they would be vastly outmatched. A Lictor will often pick off its prey in ones and twos whilst they are separated from their comrades, sometimes retreating for days at a time before launching a further attack. When the time comes to strike, Lictors are brutally efficient, with a whole arsenal of bio-weaponry that includes mantis-like claws, talons that can pierce steel, barbed flesh hooks and feeder tendrils. The feeder tendrils are tipped with sharpened bony plates that can pierce a victim’s skull as easily as they poke through eyeballs and the sockets behind. They are used to lobotomise victims so that the Lictor can swiftly devour its brain and absorb its memories. Thus, in death, the enemy reveals more to a Lictor than it ever did in life, betraying the whereabouts of comrades and exposing any weaknesses that might be exploited. Yet fearsome as the Lictor is as a physical foe, it has an altogether more deadly purpose than simple slaughter. Stalking Lictors exude a pheromone trail which draws other Tyranids; the larger the concentration of prey, the stronger the response and the more irresistible the lure. So it is that even killing a Lictor is no guarantee of survival, for the creature’s mere presence ensures that the swarm already knows where its prey can be found. After that, it’s only a matter of time..."

Few foes are foolish enough to stand before a feeding Haruspex, for it can devour an entire platoon of soldiers in a matter of moments, shovelling victim after victim into its craw without ever slowing down. Any morsel that proves too large to be swallowed in one gulp is seized with the Haruspex’s gargantuan claws and ripped, crushed or battered apart with negligent ease. Buildings are smashed open, battle tanks torn asunder and the unfortunate prey sheltering inside hungrily devoured. Only those that turn and flee have any hope of survival, and only then if they can avoid the Haruspex’s grasping tongue as it lashes out to grab hold of its prey and drag it, kicking and screaming, into its vast maw."

descr "Tyranid Shrikes are an adaptation of the Tyranid Warrior bioform, with leathery wings that allow them to swoop and soar through the skies of a prey world. With broods of Tyranid Shrikes at its command, the Hive Mind can ensure that its influence extends to every corner of the swarm, even to the Gargoyles and Harpies whose aerial assaults are prone to leaving them isolated from the rest of the force. Though more lightly armoured than Tyranid Warriors, Shrikes can redeploy at a moment’s notice. In doing so, they can fill gaps in the synaptic web or assail the foe where it is most vulnerable. Few enemies expect so large a creature to approach from the skies, and a well-timed attack by Tyranid Shrikes invariably spells disaster if the prey’s sentries are caught off guard."

Survivors spoke of a beast with a blood-coloured carapace, talons that could tunnel through rockcrete, and a maw so wide it could swallow a man whole. With every re-telling, the legends grew more fearsome and terrifying. Some claimed that the Red Terror was the size of a Ravener; others swore it was as big as a Trygon. The survivors of the Devlan massacre may well have mistaken the attacks of several such creatures for those of a single beast. However, if the Red Terror is a distinct Tyranid organism, it must be a highly efficient killer; it has never been reported since, but this can only be because there have been no survivors left to tell the tale."

spr1 "w40kmod/tyranid_3x3_harpy1.tga"
spr2 "w40kmod/tyranid_3x3_harpy1.tga"
descr "The Hive Crone is a flying monstrosity used by the Tyranids to establish air superiority over prey worlds. It is a creature perfectly adapted to aerial combat, able to wrestle enemy aircraft out of the skies as proficiently as any daredevil pilot at the controls of a sophisticated jet-fighter. A clutch of parasitic tentaclids nestle underneath a Hive Crone’s wings, latched on until launched at enemy aircraft. Upon leaving their host, these creatures speed through the air, homing in on their target with unerring accuracy. When these living missiles strike, they emit a massive bio-electric pulse that can cripple the target’s electronics or stall their engines, leaving them without power or thrust and sending them into a fatal dive. But even without these impressive bio-missiles to shoot its prey, a Hive Crone is still deadly, flying close enough to its quarry to tear through them with the bladed spurs on its underside. Once all aerial prey has been eliminated, a Hive Crone then softens up the planet’s ground-bound defenders, swooping over the heads of the enemy soldiery and drizzling digestive fluids onto its victims. Before reaching a target planet, Hive Crones also protect bio-ships in their journeys through extragalactic space against attacks from enemy assault shuttles and bomber craft; in silence, a hive fleet’s Crones glide through the inky darkness, ripping enemy vessels open to the cold vacuum."

Once embedded, the Sporocyst coughs out clouds of polluting microorganisms that denature its host planet’s atmosphere until the air itself is ripe for digestion. When threatened, these creatures will squeeze out the flaccid spore-forms they carry, these smaller bioforms rapidly inflating to become either a cluster of Spore Mines or a larger, deadlier Mucolid Spore. There are persistent theories that the Sporocyst also acts as psychic resonators of sorts, boosting the abilities of those synapse beasts nearby to channel the Hive Mind’s ravenous imperatives."

spr1 "w40kmod/tyranid_2x2_meiotic_spore1.tga"
spr2 "w40kmod/tyranid_2x2_meiotic_spore1.tga"
descr "Meiotic Spores are large fleshy sacks full of bio-acid and spore mines. They are mindless beasts, sometimes controlled by the will of synapse creatures, but more often left to drift across a war zone until triggered by an unsuspecting foe. Though occasionally encountered at ground level, Meiotic Spores most often float high above the battlefield, their trailing tendrils alert for non-Tyranid life. When such prey is detected, the Meiotic Spore vents gas from a series of bladders, allowing it to close with alarming speed. Once the enemy is within range, the Meiotic Spore detonates, showering the area with corrosive juices. The force of this explosion is far greater than that of an ordinary Spore Mine, and is often sufficient to rupture an aircraft’s hull. Sensors, ailerons and other more sensitive equipment are almost certain to be destroyed, unless the pilot veers off at the last moment – which is as likely to send the aircraft into collision with another Meiotic Spore as it is to bring salvation. In the first recorded encounter with Meiotic Spores, Space Marines of the Red Scorpions Chapter suffered severe losses to their fleet of Thunderhawk Gunships before they could develop effective countermeasures. Many of the Spore Mines within a Meiotic Spore are detonated alongside their parent, their demise adding to the force of the already formidable blast. Some, however, are flung free, and continue to drift in search of new targets – which normally transpire to be any crew or passengers who have bailed out of the doomed aircraft. Thus is the threat of a Meiotic Spore often not ended simply by shooting it down."

Biovores thump forward in battle, bony protrusions on their fore-limbs anchoring themselves into the ground as they release their vile payload in a single shuddering spasm. As the Spore Mine is flung through the air, its internal gas bladder inflates and it floats down towards ground level. Even if the shot misses its initial target, the danger it poses is far from over; for the Spore Mine is possessed of a rudimentary intelligence and detonates not on impact with the ground, but when it senses the proximity of a non-Tyranid life form."

spr2 "w40kmod/tyranid_3x3_trygon1.tga"
descr "The Trygon is a vast serpentine creature, so colossal that it towers over even the mighty Carnifex. It is a heavily armoured monster, covered from head to tail with a thick carapace of shifting plates. As the Trygon moves, these plates generate a potent bio-static charge that courses along the length of the beast’s body and wreathes its bladed forelimbs with crackling power. The Trygon can direct this energy as a lethal high-voltage discharge – unleashing pulsing arcs of lightning that leave its prey as little more than a charred pile of scorched bones. A Trygon’s claws are not only fearsome in close combat, they also allow it to burrow through practically any material. When a Trygon detects an enemy above, it digs upwards, bursting through the ground with explosive force, its huge claws scything through warriors and tanks alike. Such attacks are hard to detect and harder to defend against, especially on worlds with background seismic activity. Once the beast emerges, only focused heavy-weapons fire can be relied upon to bring it down, for the Trygon’s iron-hard carapace is proof against all else. Trygons excavate a massive network of underground tunnels as they burrow beneath the surface of a prey world. Other Tyranid creatures use the passageways left in the Trygon’s wake, scuttling unseen as battle rages overhead. The emergence of a tunnelling Trygon therefore often heralds a larger Tyranid attack, with hordes of creatures pouring out of the tunnel shortly after its emergence."

The Exocrine is purely a means of transportation for the weapon symbiote nested into its flesh. Whilst the Exocrine possesses considerable strength, it has a disproportionately small brain. Indeed, the dorsal bio-weapon has a larger mental capacity than its host and often diverts a portion of its own intelligence to subsume the Exocrine’s will. Only when the larger beast remains still can the symbiote focus all of its mental resources into targeting and destroying its prey."

spr2 "w40kmod/tyranid_3x3_tyranofex1.tga"
descr "There can be little doubt that the massive Tyrannofex exists purely for destruction – it is a monster created for the most apocalyptic and gruelling of battlegrounds. Striding ominously towards their prey, these alien giants deal death from afar, shattering enemy battle lines with merciless salvos of bio-weapons fire. The only way to stop the unrelenting slaughter is to slay the beast, but a Tyrannofex has the fortitude of a living battle fortress and is heedless of all but the heaviest enemy ordnance. Clad in ablative layers of chitinous armour, a Tyrannofex is as unyielding as any war engine built of steel or born of conventional technology. Given its enormous bulk, a Tyrannofex is ponderous and prone to being overwhelmed in a protracted melee. Therefore, the Hive Mind rarely unleashes such a creature without at least a brood or more of Termagants to act as close support and defence, allowing the Tyrannofex itself to concentrate on blasting the enemy asunder with its fearsome weapon symbiotes."

spr1 "w40kmod/tyranid_3x3_toxicrene1.tga"
spr2 "w40kmod/tyranid_3x3_toxicrene1.tga"
descr "Physically imposing, the Toxicrene looms over the scuttling broods it accompanies to battle. Its tentacle-limbs thrash at those who venture too close, impaling or throttling them before they can land a telling blow. Yet it is the choking clouds of spores that blast out from the Toxicrene’s dorsal chimneys that give the beast its fell reputation. Each foul-smelling cloud is composed of millions of tiny Tyranid spore organisms that wind towards their prey like evil sulphur-spirits. These clouds are possessed of a predatory sentience, and deliberately force themselves into the respiratory systems of the Toxicrene’s victims. There they nestle and embed, feeding on the moisture of their host and growing at an astonishing rate. Organs rupture and split, airways close and lungs fill with gore, even as blood spills from every orifice."

descr "When a Tyranid hive ship launches a pre-digestive assault, its creatures are transported to the planet’s surface by tentacled ovoids known as Tyrannocytes. Though each spore appears to be little more than a giant veiny sac, it is in fact a creature unto itself – and one possessed of its own fierce appetites. Spat from the quivering orifices of the hive ships in low orbit, the Tyrannocyte thunders through the tortured skies to slam into the surface of its target world. This impact will cause its gravid belly to split, disgorging the Tyranids inside in a spray of grisly fluids. Once its passengers have been delivered, the Tyrannocyte fills with gaseous emissions and floats eerily into the air. There it begins to obey its own murderous instincts, the bio-weapons that fringe its crown spitting death as its barbed tendrils quest for prey."

spr2 "w40kmod/tyranid_3x3_tyrannocyte1.tga"
descr "When a Tyranid hive ship launches a pre-digestive assault, its creatures are transported to the planet’s surface by tentacled ovoids known as Tyrannocytes. Though each spore appears to be little more than a giant veiny sac, it is in fact a creature unto itself – and one possessed of its own fierce appetites. Spat from the quivering orifices of the hive ships in low orbit, the Tyrannocyte thunders through the tortured skies to slam into the surface of its target world. This impact will cause its gravid belly to split, disgorging the Tyranids inside in a spray of grisly fluids. Once its passengers have been delivered, the Tyrannocyte fills with gaseous emissions and floats eerily into the air. There it begins to obey its own murderous instincts, the bio-weapons that fringe its crown spitting death as its barbed tendrils quest for prey."

setclassname	"Tyranid Hive"
classdescr "The Tyranids are an ancient race of hyper-aggressive aliens; a vast swarm of predators biologically adapted to kill and consume. Against such a consummate foe, even the mightiest of armies are naught but prey for the slaughter. The Tyranids are a race of ravenously hungry aliens. They have travelled through the cold darkness of the intergalactic void, hibernating for aeons in order to feed upon the planets of our galaxy. Now they have awakened, sinking their tendrils ever deeper into populated space like a galactic plague of locusts. Impossibly large swarms of scuttling creatures, winged horrors and towering monstrosities consume everything in their path, scouring whole worlds of life as they seek to slake an insatiable appetite. The Tyranid race continuously learns and adapts, spawning new warriors and beasts of war to better defeat its foes. Unrelenting and unstoppable, the Tyranids represent an unimaginable threat, not only to Mankind, but to the whole galaxy."

# "Since the very first deployments of the Sicaran Battle Tank, a number of Forge Lords and Mechanicum Magi had contemplated the potential benefits of utilising the vehicle's speed and mobility to as an Armoured Transport for the elite warriors of the Legiones Astartes. However, despite myraid different approaches from a dozen Forge Worlds, success could not be found, with the complexity of the Sicaran's internal construction hampering any attempts to extend its hull to allow for an expanded transport capacity. ^^Instead, the Magi of Armatura conceived of a Sicaran variant which combined a smaller passenger contingent allowed for by the existing hull with a suite of sensory and communication systems, which would allow the transport to function as a reconnaissance or command vehicle whilst maintaining considerable firepower. Although the Sicaran Advancer tended to find favour amongst specialist Legion formations rather than mainline forces, the limited production run before the Heresy's outbreak resulted in most vehicles being assigned as dedicated transports for commanding officers, a role in which the vehicle excelled."

# Ionic Flare Shield
# When a Cerastus Knight-Atrapos is deployed, and subsequently at the start of each of the opposing side’s Shooting phases, the Cerastus Knight-Atrapos’ controlling player must declare which facing each Cerastus Knight-Atrapos’ ion shield is covering. The choices are front, left side, right side or rear. The Knight has a 4+ invulnerable save against all hits and the strength of any Shooting attack against it is reduced by -1, the effect increasing to -2 if the weapon has the Blast or Template special rules (note however that this strength reduction has no effect on Destroyer or Haywire attacks). Ionic flare shields are repositioned before any attacks are carried out in the Shooting phase and may not be used to make saving throws against close combat attacks.

If this attack damages a bulkhead or wall section of terrain and destroys it, remove that section of terrain from play if possible.
# Collapsing Singularity: 
# Before firing the weapon, roll a D6. On a result of a 1, the firing Knight-Atrapos suffers a single Hull Point of damage with no saves of any kind before the attack is carried out. On a result of a 6, the attack is carried out with the Vortex special rule.

# Cerastus Knight-Acheron
# imperial_knights_3x3_cerastus_knight_acheron1
# "The devastation wrought by Knights-Acheron is terrifying to behold. Armed with a fearsome reaper chainfist, twin-linked heavy bolters and an Acheron pattern flame cannon, they are employed as weapons of extermination and to inspire fear in their foes. Nothing will sway their attack until the enemy is utterly crushed, never to rise again from the flame-scoured ruins of their strongholds."
# "Acheron pattern Knights are deadly variations on the Cerastus, configured as rapid moving strike units who rose to prominence during the legendary battles of the Great Crusade, but whose most terrible renown was to be found on the battlefields of the Horus Heresy. Rare, even in those ancient times for the singular difficulties of their construction, the Cerastus Knight-Acherons were amongst the most dreaded of their age. ^^The Acherons’ machine spirits were regarded as particularly lusting for wanton destruction and only the strongest scion-minds  could master them via the Throne Mechanicum, especially during the tumult of open battle. Of particular savagery was the paired armament carried by the Acheron; a powerful incendiary flame cannon whose sophistication allowed it a projection all but equal to a Titan class weapon, combined with a deadly reaper chainfist designed to tear apart heavy armour and rip great chunks of wreckage from any war machine whose innards it breached."

# Questoris Knight Magaera
# imperial_knights_3x3_cerastus_knight_magaera1
# "Magaera type Knights are most often used as shock assault units, breaching the most heavily defended enemy positions, while shrugging off heavy weapons fire and self-repairing even devastating weapon strikes in a few minutes. To aid in this role it is armed with a complex lightning cannon, using focussed electro-magnetic beams to vaporise infantry and blast apart armour."
# "Long considered a dark and ill-omened relic of bloody ages past, the few Knight Magaera still kept operational in the 41st Millennium are considered weapons of last resort by the small number of Knight Households that maintain them; powerful, but according to some Sacristans, accursed. It is said such Knight Armours were once the gift of the Mechanicum to those Houses they held in high regard or which to curry favour with —or perhaps enslave if the darkest rumours were true— and that they were created by fusing STC technologies with macabre innovations that should not have been made. Regardless, the strange arcana used to arm and equip them, particularly the singularly powerful shield technology whose demands tax its reactor core to the limit, are now irreplaceable mysteries of the past."

# "Armed with the fearsome Castigator pattern bolt cannon, the Cerastus Knight-Castigator is favoured by those households faced with hordes of lesser foes that might otherwise overwhelm even a mighty Knight through sheer numbers. Capable of obliterating infantry formations in a thunderous rain of mass-reactive explosions and whirling power blade, or carving apart light vehicles with ease, the Castigator is a formidable opponent."
# "Ancient war machines, Castigator Knights are variations on the Cerastus frame designed foremost to carry out flanking attacks and respond rapidly to enemy manoeuvres in those distant ages in which hundreds of Knights and their retainers clashed in savage battle. The few that have survived to the present day are priceless heirlooms of their Households. ^^The Castigator’s custom-pattern, powerful rapid-firing bolt cannon are particularly suited to sweeping aside enemy infantry forces and devastating light war machines. The Castigator’s feared tempest sword however, is perhaps its deadliest weapon; a complex relic fitted with strange and lethal energy generation systems now little understood in the 41st Millennium even by the Sacristans that tend them. It is capable of rendering vast swathes of foes to burning ash, or indeed, of carving a fellow Knight to molten ruin."

# Tempest warblade
# Ion shield
#Special Rules:
#Flank Speed
#(Super-heavy Walker) Fear, Hammer of Wrath, Invincible Behemoth, Move Through Cover, Relentless, Smash and Strikedown
# Castigator bolt cannon 36" S7 Ap3 Heavy 8
# Tempest warblade R- S10 Ap2 Melee, Deflagrate, Tempest Attack, Sunder
# Deflagrate:
# After normal attacks by this weapon have been resolved, count the number of unsaved wounds caused on  the target unit. Immediately resolve a number of additional automatic hits on the same unit using the weapon’s profile equal to the number of unsaved wounds – these can then be saved normally. Models in the targeted unit must still be in range in order for these additional hits to take effect. These additional hits do not themselves inflict more hits!
# Tempest Attack:
# Rather than attacking normally, the Knight may make a special attack at Initiative Step 2. This automatically inflicts a single hit against each model in base contact with it using the weapon’s listed profile.
# Sunder:
# Attacks with this special rule may re-roll failed Armour Penetration rolls.

# Cerastus Shock Lance
# Ion Gauntlet shield
# Special Rules: Flank Speed
# Flank Speed
# If the Cerastus Knight-Lancer opts to make a Run move  rather than firing a weapon in the Shooting phase, it may  move 3D6".
# Ion Gauntlet Shield
# The ion gauntlet shield generator mounted in the Cerastus’ right gauntlet assembly is more concentrated than the  directional ion shield mounted on the Knight Paladin, but  lacks its tactical flexibility. The ion gauntlet shield is used just as a standard ion shield is (see Codex: Imperial Knights), but may not offer protection to the Cerastus Knight-Lancer’s rear. However, the ion gauntlet shield also provides a 5+ invulnerable save against attacks in close combat and forces close combat attacks by other Super-heavy Walkers and Gargantuan Monstrous Creatures to suffer a -1 to hit. 
#Cerastus Shock Lance
# The shock lance mounted on the Cerastus is a magneto-hydraulic power spear of prodigious size, whose disruption field may also be projected as a powerful electromagnetic plasma blast over short ranges. The weapon has two profiles, one of which is used in close combat, the other can be used in the Shooting phase:
# Shock lance (Melee) 
# Range- SD Ap2 Melee, Swift Strike
# Shock lance (Energy Blast) 
# 18" S7 Ap2 Heavy 6, Concussive
# Swift Strike: 
# The weapon gains a +1 bonus to Initiative on any turn it charges into close combat.
# "The Cerastus Knight-Lancer is a first strike weapon, attuned to rapid assault tactics and lethal outflanking charges against a foe. It is justly renowned for its speed and its power, as well as for the temperamental and restive nature of the machine-spirits which dwell as anima within its colossal frame. ^^Because of this reputation, the most impetuous and glory-hungry of the Knight Households are driven to bond with these war machines, their own souls a match for the fury caged within their mounts. The greatest of these pairings will go on to create martial legends among their lineage, while for those whose temper cannot fully master that of their Knight-engine or whose own lust for glory might see valour outweigh caution on the battlefield, their triumphs are likely to blaze brightly, if briefly, in the chronicles of their Households."

# imperial_knights_3x3_warhound_titan1
# Warhounds are the smallest class of 'true' Titan, although small in this case is purely in relation to its colossal brethren the Battle Titans. Classified as 'Scouts' in reference to their common operational roles within the Diviso Militaris of the Titan Legions, they are commonly used to range ahead of larger Titan battle groups or detached in support of lesser ground forces, where the sheer scale and power of their weapons is enough to turn the tide of most battles in their allies' favour. ^^If matched against their larger counterparts however, they cannot hope to directly contest them in terms of durability or raw firepower, so instead Warhounds must rely on their speed and manoeuvrability to survive, and use pack tactics to bring down the Titans of a main battle line."

# Wargear:
# Arm-mounted Vulcan mega bolter
# Arm-mounted Titan plasma blastgunp
# Special Rules:
# Agile
# Night Vision
# Reactor Meltdown
# God-Engine
# Void Shields (2)
# Towering Monstrosity (Warhound Titan)
# Options:
# A Warhound Scout Titan may exchange either of its arm-mounted weapons for any of the following (in all cases these also have the Primary Weapon Special Rule):
# Vulcan mega-bolter -free
# Double-barrelled turbo laser destructor -free
# Titan plasma blastgun -free
# Warhound inferno gun -free
# Reactor Meltdown
# If the Warhound suffers a Titanic Explosion result on the Catastrophic Damage table, its reactor goes nuclear! This is the same as a Titanic Explosion, except that all hits are resolved as Destroyer hits
# Agile
# In the Shooting phase, the Warhound may divert some of the energy from its primary weapons towards its motive systems so it can choose to:
# Fire all available weapons, as normal
# Or fire a single primary weapon and move an extra D6"
# Or fire no weapons at all and move an extra 2D6"
#God Engine
# All Mechanicum units within 24" and on the same side of a model with this special rule are fearless
# Void Shields (2)
# A Legio Titanicus Warhound Scout Titan has two void shields. Each hit scored against a Warhound Titan will instead hit a void shield (whilst at least one remains active). Close combat attacks come from inside the shield and therefore are not stopped. Void shields have an Armour value of 12. A glancing or Penetrating hit (or any hit from a Destroyer weapon) scored against a void shield causes it to collapse. After all void shields have collapsed, further hits strike the Titan instead. At the end of each of the Titan's turns, roll a D6 for each collapsed void shield. Each roll of 5+ instantly restores one collapsed shield.
# - I could model this as 3 unit versions, switching between them with shrink and growhp commands. 
#1 Void shields (2) :2 intact shields, Large shield + displacement
#2 Void shields (1) :1 intact shield, Small shield + displacement
#3 Void shields (inactive): regeneration (which can re-enable the small shield but can't heal it to full health.)
# Towering Monstrosity (Warhound Titan)
# The Titan may never be locked in an assault
# The Titan is completely immune to the effects of Haywire attacks, dangerous terrain, and psychic attacks other than Witchfire powers, which must attempt to damage it normally.

# "The Reaver is a Battle Titan and a mainstay of the great Titan Legions. It is smaller and lighter than the massive Warlord class, but is still a vast machine, protected by thick adamantine armour plates and carries devastating firepower. ^^A truly ancient design, each Titan Legion maintains an active number of Reavers of various paterns and, in particular the Mars pattern Reaver is said to be the oldest of all Titans forged on the Red Planet, its origins long predating even the Great Crusade. Each god-machine is regarded as a holy-of-holies by the Mechanicum; a reflection of the divine Omnissiah's wrath that has brought destruction to their enemies and shielded their brethren from harm for countless centuries back into the long night of the Age of Strife. ^^Only another war machine of similar power or entire tank battalions working together has any hope of defeating a Reaver Battle Titan in the field, as against the Reaver's void shields and devastating weaponry, conventional ground troops and defences stand little chance."

# "The colossal Mars pattern Warlord Titan is among the most ancient and feared of the Imperium’s war machines. Forged on the Red Planet itself, it is worshipped and venerated as the Omnissiah’s will incarnate, and each god-engine is encased in layered armour and powerful void shielding, and armed with weapons that are capable of reducing armies to ash. ^^In addition to its ardex-defensor mauler bolt cannon and lascannon turrets, support weapons that would be considered main armaments on smaller war machines, the Warlord is commonly fitted with a pair of carapace-mounted triple-barrelled laser blasters and two Belicosa pattern Volcano cannon."

# "A true leviathan of the battlefield, the Warlord Class Titan is the mainstay of the Collegia Titanica. There are a number of sub-patterns of the Warlord, such as the Lucius and the Anvilus, but it is the Mars that is considered the most ancient and superior, and of all the Battle Titan types by far the most numerous and iconic. This is not without reason, for each Mars Warlord is a gargantuan killing machine, proof against the petty assaults of small arms and all but impervious even to the assault of most forms of attack aircraft and heavy weapon, save teh most technologically potent or massive. ^^Furthermore, the Warlord is a fully sealable and protected environment, and is able to fight upon an airless moon as a verdeant plain so long as the geology under its feet will sustain it, and even this is assisted by gravitational and inertial techno-arcana, little understood outside the inner circles of the Titan Tech-Priests who sustain these god-engines. But it is the destructive power of the Warlord that is its avatar, for their firepower rivals smaller void warships in potency and a single Warlord, given time, is capable of systematically levelling a city or laying waste to an entire enemy army. Such is their might that it is whispered by some that it is they, not the Legions Astartes, that have truly won the Imperium's domain in the fires of battle."
