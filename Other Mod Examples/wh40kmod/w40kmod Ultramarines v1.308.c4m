description 	"v1.308 of Ultramarines faction by FnF. Using 7th edition units and stats converted with some modifications to fit CoE4. Enjoy"
# If you are reading this, then welcome. I have tried to annotate the mod both for my own benefit and for that of anyone else who wishes to mod CoE4.
# Feel free to use and modify this file in any way, if I can help you create something fun, or to have fun, then I am happy.

# This mod has been made using Warhammer 40k, 7th edition unit models and stats with some modifications to fit CoE4 stats.
# Changes to balance can be made by tweaking the rules used for converting 40k stats to CoE4.  After that it is a simple, 
# albeit slow and repetitive process of applying the changes to the units/weapons/spells affected by that rule.
# (You can find the original 40k stats in comments # next to the unit/weapon in question. Not all units/weapons are done, it is a work in progress.)

# -------------------------  Rules for Converting 40k to CoE4 -------------------------
# Damage = WS for melee weapon modifier, S for weapon damage, BS for ranged weapon modifier

#Trooper Stats:
#hp = T x Wounds x 3 (+6 for leaders) 
#mr = Ld/2 (+ 1 for leaders) (+3 for psykers)
#str = S
#armor = Toughness -2 or Armour save, whichever is higher: 
#						Sv-=0 Sv6+=0 Sv5+=1 Sv4+=2 Sv3+=3 Sv2+=4 Sv1+=5
# Sv2+ or better gains pierce/slash/blunt res.
#mor = ld
#rank = 0 #mid for ranged, 1 #melee for assault, -1 #rear for leaders
#meleeweapon <WS -4> "weapon name"
#meleeweaponlong <WS -4> "weapon" for lances/powerswords/whips
#rangedweapon50 <BS -4> "weapon" for pistols
#assassinweapon <dmg> "weapon name" for sniper rifles or stealthy unit weapons
#siegeweapon <dmg> "weapon name" for Heavy weapons 3+

#Vehicle Stats:
#Vehicle HP = Sum of armour values x HP
#Vehicle Armour = Vehicle front armour -9
#Vehicle armour +1 for 10pts
#Vehicles gain Roman Female names #nametype 18 #Roman female

#Space Marines gain:
#human, poisonres 50, affres 30, nametype 6 #Roman male 
#Those in terminator armour/Sv2+ gain: affres 60, fireres 50, nametype 39 #Angelic
#leadership 1 #Sergeant
#localleadership 2 #for banner bearers / Upgraded Sergeant
##leadership 3 #Major heroes
#allitemslots #Standard troop
#miscslots #Vehicles

#power 0 1 #for sergeant
#power 0 2 #for Upgraded Sergeant
#mastery 1 #for un-upgraded units (1 being the next monster offset)



# -------------------------  Short Guide to Rituals -------------------------
# Rituals are placed on lines above the unit that is planning to use them. e.g.

#newritpow
#newritual	"Amazingybob"
#level 1

#newritual	"Awesomesauce"
#level 2

#newmonster "Thingy"
#power 0 1

#newritual	"Really Awesomesauce"
#level 1

# This will allow the level 1 unit "Thingy" to cast:
# "Amazingybob" as it is level 1, but not "Awesomesauce" as it is level 2.
# "Thingy" also cannot cast "Really Awesomesauce" as it is below it in the list.

# ------------------------- Weapon Modding Information -------------------------
# Weapons used by a race must be present in the mod to allow each module to function independently.
# (Otherwise units will be missing weapons if the master file isn't loaded)
# The duplicate weapons should be identical to prevent any quirks occurring from the load order.  
# (Otherwise the last loaded or a random weapon will be chosen... lots of strangeness all around)

# ------------------------ Ranged Weapon Modding begins here: ------------------------

# The vulcan mega-bolter screams as it spits out swathes of mass-reactive shells. Wherever the mega-bolter’s fire rakes across the foe, they disintegrate, blasted into puffs of blood and piles of wreckage in seconds. Warriors fighting beneath the barrels of these chattering weapons must wade knee-deep through spent shell casings, struggling to reach their foes through drifts of smoking brass

# ------------------------- Back to Techmarine -------------------------
# TECHMARINE 65pts
# UNIT TYPE:
# Infantry. Techmarine is Infantry (Character).
# UNIT COMPOSITION:
# 1 Techmarine
# WARGEAR:
# TECHMARINE
# • Bolt pistol
# • Power axe
# • Frag grenades
# • Krak grenades
# • Servo-arm
# SERVITOR
# • Servo-arm
# SPECIAL RULES:
# TECHMARINE
# • And They Shall Know No Fear
# • Chapter Tactics
# • Independent Character
# Blessing of the Omnissiah: In each of your Shooting phases, instead of firing his weapons, a Techmarine can choose to repair a single friendly vehicle that he is in base contact with or embarked upon. To repair a vehicle, roll a D6 and add 1 for each Servitor with a servo-arm in his unit, and an additional 1 if the Techmarine has a servo-harness. If the result is a 5 or more, you may either restore a Hull Point lost earlier in the battle, or repair a Weapon Destroyed or Immobilised result suffered earlier in the battle; this is effective immediately.
# Bolster Defences: After deployment, but before Scout redeployments and Infiltrate deployments, nominate one piece of terrain in your deployment zone (this cannot be one you have purchased as part of your army). The terrain piece’s cover save is increased by 1 for the duration of the game (to a maximum of 3+). Note that a piece of terrain can only be bolstered once.
# SERVITOR
# Mindlock: If it does not contain a Techmarine, an unengaged unit that contains at least one model with this special rule must roll a D6 at the start of its turn. On a 4+, this special rule has no effect this turn. On a 1, 2 or 3, the unit is mindlocked until the start of its following turn. A mindlocked unit may not voluntarily move, shoot or charge, but must still complete compulsory moves, such as Pile In and Fall Back moves.
# OPTIONS:
# Techmarine
#• May replace servo-arm with one of the following:
#- Conversion beamer…20 pts
#- Servo-harness…25 pts
#• May take items from the Melee Weapons, Ranged Weapons, Special Issue
#Wargear and/or Chapter Relics lists.
#• May take up to five Servitors…10 pts each
#Servitor
#• Up to two Servitors may replace their servo-arm with one of the following:
#- Heavy bolter…10 pts/model
#- Multi-melta…10 pts/model
#- Plasma cannon…20 pts/model

spr1 "w40kmod/ultra_2x2_techmarine1.tga"
spr2 "w40kmod/ultra_2x2_techmarine1.tga"
descr "Techmarines perform their sacred duty with cold logic and precision, laying their target low with precise shots from their high-tech weaponry. These warrior artisans are responsible for the vehicles of their Chapter’s arsenal, and they will face any danger to safeguard their armoured wards. The Techmarines’ knowledge of the machine allows them to effect field repairs upon damaged vehicles, but they are also more than capable of bringing destruction to the enemy. Many bear ancient items of wargear, blasting their foes to ruin from afar or carving them down at close quarters with heavy-bladed power axes. Others surround themselves with retinues of Servitors, these cybernetic, greyfleshed figures staring with dead eyes at the foe even as they rip them apart with powered claws and thudding heavy weapons."

descr "Each Space Marine Captain is one of the greatest and most acclaimed warriors in the galaxy. Delivering clipped commands with calm authority, the Captain inspires his brothers, forging them into a single, lethal force upon the field of battle. The Captain knows the strengths of every squad, vehicle and weapon at his command. Peerless tactical genius turns this knowledge into fluid, devastating strategies that leave even the most swift-witted foes scrambling to respond. Yet the Captains of the Adeptus Astartes are more than just skilled generals. Each is a noble and accomplished warrior who leads his brothers by his glorious example. A Space Marine Captain fights with the skill, nobility and courage, and will never admit defeat."

A sole thought encases his battle brothers in shields of impenetrable energy, or invigorates them with unnatural strength and resilience. The unbridled fury of the Warp is amongst the most dangerous of powers in the galaxy, and it is testament to the Space Marine Librarians that they are able to wield this lethal energy as their brothers might fire a boltgun or swing a blade. To a Librarian, the very weave of reality is theirs to wield as a weapon, while even the secrets of the future can be torn loose and used to outmanoeuvre the foe."

spr1 "w40kmod/ultra_2x2_captain_sicarius1.tga"
spr2 "w40kmod/ultra_2x2_captain_sicarius1.tga"
descr "Cato Sicarius is the undisputed master of the lightning assault, his forces falling upon their foes like a sudden storm. Sicarius’ strategic brilliance is well known; the Captain can appraise the most complex tactical situation with little more than a glance, deploying his warriors with a decisiveness that borders upon arrogance. Yet there is no intended boastfulness in Sicarius’ direct style of command, just the absolute self-confidence of a master at work. ^^Sicarius has trained with a blade since he was old enough to grip one, and as a swordsman he is without equal. His Tempest Blade whips through the air in a shimmering blur of cuts, thrusts and parries that no foe can long survive. Between his skill as a leader and his personal accomplishments as a warrior, Sicarius’ fame has spread far beyond the borders of Ultramar. He leads the 2nd Company to victory as easily as he overcomes every other obstacle set in his path, and many believe Sicarius is the obvious successor to Calgar himself."

# Chaplain Cassius
# Ultramarines Master of Sanctity

newmonster "Master of Sanctity" #130pts
spr1 "w40kmod/ultra_2x2_captain_sicarius1.tga"
spr2 "w40kmod/ultra_2x2_captain_sicarius1.tga"
descr "The fiery zeal of Chaplain Cassius has inspired generations of Ultramarines toward victory over their foes. Though ancient even by Space Marine standards, and alive only because of the extensive bionics that riddle his body, Cassius remains strong and unbowed. Indeed, far from eroding his faith, several centuries of battle have only seen it blaze hotter than ever before. Tales of Chaplain Cassius’ heroism are known galaxy-wide and he has mentored many of the Chapter’s greatest heroes, even Marneus Calgar himself. Yet since the terrible battle against Hive Fleet Behemoth during the First Tyrannic War, Cassius has focussed exclusively on the Tyranid threat. It is his belief that these monstrous xenos are Humanity’s punishment for its lack of vigilance, and that no greater cause exists than to purge these bio-horrors from the stars once and for all. To this end, Cassius leads an ever-greater number of his brothers to war against the Tyranid menace, and has even trained Deathwatch Kill Teams in the best techniques for fighting this monstrous foe."

# Vindicator BS4 F13 S11 R10 HP3

newmonster "Vindicator" 
spr1 "w40kmod/ultra_2x2_vindicator1.tga"
spr2 "w40kmod/ultra_2x2_vindicator1.tga"
descr "The thunder of a Vindicator squadron opening fire is a truly apocalyptic sound. As each cannon lets fly, the very air vibrates with the report of its fury. Yet this is nothing to the cacophony of destruction that accompanies their ammunition's earthshaking impact. As each of the siege-tanks' shells slams home, it explodes with enormous force. Barricades are blown sky high and fortress walls reduced to so much rubble in an instant. Enemies caught at the heart of the blast simply cease to exist, obliterated utterly by the Vindicators' fury. By then, the tanks are already advancing, enemy fire ricocheting off their siege shields as their autoloaders cycle, and their monstrous demolisher cannons prepare to fire again."

newmonster "Stalker"
spr1 "w40kmod/ultra_2x2_stalker1.tga"
spr2 "w40kmod/ultra_2x2_stalker1.tga"
descr "The Stalker's icarus stormcannon array fills the sky with sustained anti-aircraft fire. Lightly armoured targets are peppered with rounds, their hulls buckling and breaking under the onslaught, while even heavy flyers cannot tarry long in the hostile airspace. The paired cannons are guided by a servitor conclave, and under their control the Stalker can swiftly track multiple targets or focus its guns on a single foe for devastating effect. Squadrons of Stalkers become more effective still, loosing a rolling storm of exploding ordinance that pulverises anything foolish enough to attempt to fly through it. The Stalkers obliterate all enemy aircraft, protecting the Space Marines on the ground from aerial assault and ensuring that the skies above, as well as the battlefield below, are dominated by the Adeptus Astartes."

descr "The Razorback rolls into battle with its weapons charged and ready to fire. Its determined crew slam their vehicle through obstacles and over wreckage, keeping pace with the Adeptus Astartes' advance. Meanwhile, inside the vehicle's transport bay, its passengers ready themselves for the battle ahead. At the first sight of the enemy, the Razorback's turret lights with fury, lascannon beams or salvoes of bolt shells ripping across the battlefield. Skidding to a halt, the tank disgorges its passengers into combat. As one, transport and passengers take the fight to the foe, their potent combination of anti-infantry and tank-hunting firepower swiftly tearing the enemy apart."

descr "The ground trembles and enemies flee in fear as the mighty Land Raider advances into battle. Massively armoured and all but unstoppable, the noble war engine smashes through walls and grinds over wreckage while drumming volley after volley of fire into the foe. Beams of incandescent energy slam into enemy tanks, knifing through their armoured hulls and reducing them to blazing fireballs. Thudding bolt shells punch into the flesh of the foe before detonating in shocking sprays of gore. The kill count climbs with each passing moment as the Land Raider advances across the war zone, especially once the tank's assault ramp slams down and its Adeptus Astartes passengers charge out to add to the carnage."

descr "With surprising agility, the Stormraven smashes through its enemies in a blaze of hammering guns and screaming jet engines. Its armoured sides are proof against the ground fire of most enemies, their anti-aircraft rounds sparking harmlessly off its hull. In retaliation, the Stormraven sends down a rain of missiles, bolt rounds and searing energy blasts, sweeping the battlefield clear of foes. Coming in to land amid a hold of engines and plumes of dust, the aircraft's assault ramp whines open before it unleashes its next weapon. From within its armoured passenger compartment massive Terminators or battle-ready Assault Marines thunder forth, while a mighty Dreadnought disengages from the craft's rear grapples to bring the Emperor's vengeance to the foe."

descr "Bellowing furious, vox-amplified catechisms of hate, the Space Marine Dreadnought strides toward the foe with its guns splitting death. Small arms fire patters uselessly from the Dreadnought's armoured hull as its terrified victims try to fight back, but their efforts are to no avail. Grinding corpses beneath its armoured tread, the Dreadnought wades into the enemy midst, firing as it goes. Infantry die in droves, annihilated by the ancient walker's firepower of smashed aside by its massive hydraulic fist. Heretic war engines are made short work of, torn open or simply smashed onto their roofs by the Dreadnought's furious blows. Marching in support of its still-living brothers, a single Space Marine Dreadnought serves as both an indomitable warrior and an inspiring example of the Chapter's true and undying spirit."

descr "The slab-armoured Ironclad Dreadnought is a hammer with which to crush the foes of the Chapter. Unstoppable on the charge, and impossible to bring down with all but the heaviest of weapons, the Ironclad is a mobile battering ram and a devastating linebreaker. Where the enemy mass in fortified positions, Ironclads are set loose to bring their walls crashing down upon them. Piloted by the most belligerent of the Chapter's fallen heroes, Ironclad Dreadnoughts eschew all but the closest-ranged firepower, instead mounting a devastating array of close combat weaponry with which to smash through barricades and tear off bunker doors. Living foes fare no better, and even the largest Tyranid bio-horror or daemonic fiend can be laid low by a single thunderous blow from an Ironclad's chainfist or seismic hammer."

descr "Heroes of legend clad in mighty bodies of ceramite and adamantium, the Venerable Dreadnoughts of the Space Marines are amongst the oldest and most powerful war machines fighting on the battlefields of the 41st Millennium. Revered for the wealth of lore and history that resides within their minds, Venerable Dreadnoughts are also terrifyingly effective warriors, combining the expertise of one of the Adeptus Astartes' most skilled war heroes with the might and weaponry of a walking tank. Their every shot is deadly accurate, blasting through weak spots in their victims' armour to send even the mightiest foes crashing to the ground. Meanwhile, in close combat they fight with a natural flair little dimmed by their great age, striking doen their enemies with frightening ease"

setclassname	"Ultramarines"
classdescr "Masterful warriors and skilled strategists, the Ultramarines are the embodiment of heroism. Conquerors and protectors in equal measure, they stand for everything it means to be a Space Marine, through both their selfless courage and their strict adherence to the Codex Astartes. They have spawned more successors than any other First Founding Chapter, and each one strives always to live up to the example of their genetic forebears.  The home world of the Ultramarines is a harsh and mountainous planet called Macragge, which sits amidst the Ultramarines' realm of Ultramar. Located near the Eastern Fringe, this massively fortified enclave of star systems knows prosperity and civilisation like nowhere else in the entire Imperium. The populations of its thriving worlds compete to provide new recruits for the Ultramarines, and in their cities statues are erected immortalising those who fought and died defending the Imperium, and all of mankind, from the multitude of horrors that assault not only mankind, but the very fabric of reality itself."
