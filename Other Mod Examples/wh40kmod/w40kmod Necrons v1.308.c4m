descr "Imotekh is the phaeron of the Sautekh Dynasty, an ever-expanding galactic empire that he rules with an iron fist. He is a supreme strategist – perhaps the most accomplished in the galaxy – and his military manoeuvres encompass entire star systems. Imotekh’s plans are always many stages ahead of his foes’, set to take advantage of their mistakes long before they are made. He designs counter-strategies and contingencies so that they trigger automatically, should certain circumstances occur or thresholds be crossed. ^^A master of using terror as a weapon, Imotekh leads his armies to war beneath the cover of billowing storm clouds that lash the foe with bolts of emerald lightning. Bloodswarm nanoscarabs spread confusion and horror amongst the enemy ranks, and draw in packs of ravening Flayed Ones to add to the carnage of his advance. ^^Imotekh has but one weakness – a compulsion to humble and disfigure his foes rather than slaying them outright. This dangerous conceit may yet prove the phaeron’s downfall."

descr "Unlike so many of his peers, Anrakyr awoke from his long sleep untainted by madness. Driven by a sense of nobility, Anrakyr gathered his great legions and set out into the stars to unite the dynasties once again. Since that day he has travelled far, obliterating countless alien invaders and awakening one slumbering tomb world after another. ^^From each world he saves, Anrakyr demands a tithe of warriors to replace the losses he has sustained in his never-ending war of reclamation. The Traveller will requisition these troops by force if he must – a practice that has led to some Overlords branding Anrakyr as a pirate, a bandit and a thief. ^^Although he awoke with his mind intact, a strange quirk of Anrakyr’s revivification has left him able to force his consciousness into the targeting systems of enemy war engines, granting him brief control of the vehicles’ weapons. So it is that anyone who takes to the field against Anrakyr should be wary of their own guns, as well as those of their foe."

Before this journey can see completion, Szeras must unlock the very secrets of life itself – a goal that yet proves elusive. So it is that his efforts to collect and disassemble every form of life in the galaxy continue apace. A distasteful yet undeniably useful by-product of Szeras’ research are his manifold breakthroughs in the field of augmentation. Many Overlords have made use of his skills to improve their underlings’ cognitive capacity, bodily resilience or countless other combat systems. In exchange, the Illuminor will claim his pick of living specimens harvested by his latest patron’s forces. Szeras frequently takes to the field himself in order to ensure the quality of his living tithe, scuttling into battle with his disturbingly insectile gait and cutting down scores of lesser foes while he coldly selects his next luckless specimens."

Each phaeron will also lay claim to a crownworld, from which he rules his entire dynasty and from where he will build his armies of reclamation. ^^These Lords of the Necrons, though lesser in stature and power than an Overlord or phaeron, are nonetheless formidable foes in their own right, and often march to war at the head of a vast mechanical army. Independent of their monarchs, Lords are cunning leaders and pitiless commanders, focused upon the destruction of their foes and their own personal glory. However, when fighting alongside an Overlord or phaeron they will form part of a Royal Court – a terrifying gathering of immortal nobles, each one vying for influence and bent upon completing their own agendas."

Such work is beneath the nobility, and especially below those of such esteemed rank as he. Rather, a pair of Necron Warriors are slaved to the craft’s controls, acting as pilots and gunners for the barge’s underslung weaponry, leaving their master free to direct his regal attentions to the field at large. Should the Overlord wish to engage his foes in personal combat, the Necron pilots will guide the craft into the ranks of the foe so that their lord might test his blade."

descr "Remorseless, implacable and armed with terrifying gauss weaponry, legions of Necron Warriors emerge from their stasis-crypts to slay the living. Once, these unfeeling soldiers were the mortal citizens of the Necrontyr, but their flesh was stripped away and forged anew in the ancient past by unfathomable technologies. Necron Warriors are practically unkillable – their living metal bodies are able to heal all but the most grievous of wounds in a matter of moments. Even dismemberment is but a momentary state for a Necron Warrior, as its mangled body reforms itself before the horrified eyes of its enemies. To resist a Necron Warrior is to resist the inevitable onset of death itself."

descr "Awakening from sleep damaged and dysfunctional this Necron is a mindless automaton, no longer following any master, nor aware of any orders, moving only at the whim of fragmented memories that send it on hallucinatory errands. Remorseless, implacable and armed with terrifying gauss weaponry, legions of Necron Warriors emerge from their stasis-crypts to slay the living. Once, these unfeeling soldiers were the mortal citizens of the Necrontyr, but their flesh was stripped away and forged anew in the ancient past by unfathomable technologies. Necron Warriors are practically unkillable – their living metal bodies are able to heal all but the most grievous of wounds in a matter of moments. Even dismemberment is but a momentary state for a Necron Warrior, as its mangled body reforms itself before the horrified eyes of its enemies. To resist a Necron Warrior is to resist the inevitable onset of death itself."

These specialist killers are possessed of a patience known only to the undying, and once a Deathmark has marked its prey, nothing will stand between it and its target. Unerringly accurate and single-minded in their devotion to the kill, they are often employed to locate and destroy enemy commanders, or hunt down priority targets in order to disrupt their foe’s strategy. Though some phaerons consider the use of the Deathmarks to contravene the ancient Necrontyr codes of honour, none can dispute their effectiveness when given a target. ^^Deathmarks have the terrifying ability to slip beyond realspace to pursue their quarry, ambushing from pocket dimensions detached from the material universe. From these timeless places they dispassionately analyse the flow of battle, awaiting the perfect moment to flicker into reality and strike. Physical defences offer no sanctuary against a squad of Deathmarks: towering ramparts, subterranean bunkers and vast gateways are bypassed as though no barrier existed at all.

Their ghastly appearance can be attributed to the flayer virus – a curse of the C’tan Llandu’gor. Cast upon his betrayers in his final moments of existence, it has ravaged the minds of certain doomed Necrons, awakening in them an unquenchable hunger for the warm flesh and blood of the living. Though it can gain no sustenance from its prey, a Flayed One still uselessly crams gobbets of meat into its mouth, runnels of gore running like crimson rivers between the grille of its metal ribcage. ^^ Those afflicted are banished from their tomb worlds, lest their curse spread further. Some lords have even attempted to exterminate the Flayed Ones in order to bring an end to their malady – so far, however, these efforts have been in vain. By instinct, the outcast Flayed Ones gather in the Bone Kingdom of Drazak, drawn together by the stench of rotting meat and dried blood. Though they heed no master, when the legions march to war Flayed Ones will often wriggle through the skin of reality to follow. Then, when the scent of death is thick upon the air and the screams of the dying echo across the battlefield, they will strike, long, needle-like claws carving apart their foes in a frenzy of blood and carnage."

Though it can gain no sustenance from its prey, a Flayed One still uselessly crams gobbets of meat into its mouth, runnels of gore running like crimson rivers between the grille of its metal ribcage. ^^ Those afflicted are banished from their tomb worlds, lest their curse spread further. Some lords have even attempted to exterminate the Flayed Ones in order to bring an end to their malady – so far, however, these efforts have been in vain. By instinct, the outcast Flayed Ones gather in the Bone Kingdom of Drazak, drawn together by the stench of rotting meat and dried blood. Though they heed no master, when the legions march to war Flayed Ones will often wriggle through the skin of reality to follow. Then, when the scent of death is thick upon the air and the screams of the dying echo across the battlefield, they will strike, long, needle-like claws carving apart their foes in a frenzy of blood and carnage."

When a Triarch Stalker advances, it does so with a speed and surety that belies its jerking gait. Indeed, it can cover all manner of terrain with a deftness and precision seldom found in the walkers of less advanced races. Capable of operating as an opportunist tank hunter or flushing infantry from dense – and otherwise impassable – terrain, the Triarch Stalker is a versatile and mobile weapons platform. Its pilot will direct his every effort to augmenting the efforts of nearby Necron forces, overriding their targeting protocols with augmentative data on priority victims. In this way, the Triarch Stalkers bolster the Necron line wherever it meets the greatest resistance."

spr2 "w40kmod/necron_3x3_the_nightbringer1.tga"
descr "The doom of stars and the demise of worlds, the Shard of the Nightbringer is death incarnate. When unleashed upon the battlefield, it manifests as a towering cloaked reaper that shines with a dark light – an image that resonates deeply in the primal subconscious of many of the lesser races. All who look upon the shard feel the cold fingers of death upon their throats, for in its terrible and majestic form is the inevitability of their destruction. ^^Legends tell of the Nightbringer as the first and most powerful of the C’tan. In ancient hieroscripts it is depicted as an ever-hungering god of death, feasting upon the pain and anguish of entire species. Star systems, planets and civilisations have all fallen before its dark scythe, and even the Necrons fear its coming. Millions of years after the demise of the C’tan, shards of the Nightbringer remain the most dangerous and difficult to control for the Necrons. Somewhere deep within these fragments linger the memories of the Nightbringer as it was, and its unending hatred of the race that betrayed it."

spr1 "w40kmod/necron_3x3_the_deceiver1.tga"
spr2 "w40kmod/necron_3x3_the_deceiver1.tga"
descr "A master of mistrust and lies, the Shard of the Deceiver entangles his foes in webs of illusion in order to lead them to their doom. Reality and perception are its playthings – the godfragment prefers misdirection and trickery to outright force, taking pleasure in turning its foes against one another, or wallowing in their despair before finally crushing the life from their frail bodies. Falsehoods uttered by the shard have plunged whole systems into crippling civil war, and even seen entire species become prematurely extinct. ^^If the Nightbringer was reputed to be the oldest and most powerful of the C’tan, then the Deceiver was without doubt the most cunning. Stories from the Time of Flesh and the coming of the C’tan tell of the Deceiver’s audience with the Silent King. In the Necrontyr’s darkest hour, when they faced annihilation at the hands of the Old Ones, it was the Deceiver that offered up the secrets of biotransference. A curse disguised as a tempting gift, this would prove to be the Necrontyr’s doom, and the C’tan would feast upon their remains."

descr "It was the C'tan known as Nyadra'zatha, the Burning One, who had long desired to carry his eldritch fires into the Webway and beyond, who enabled the Necrons to gain access to the Labyrinthine Dimension, showing the Necrons how to breach its boundaries. Through a series of living stone portals known as Dolmen Gates, the Necrons have finally been able to turn the Old Ones' greatest weapon to their own purpose. As a race bereft of psykers, the Necrons are incapable of Warp travel, and without access to the Webway, they would be forced to rely once more on slow-voyaging stasis-ships, dooming them to isolation within the galaxy."

Llandu'gor, the Flayer ^^The Flayer, known by the ancient Necron name of Llandu'gor and as Llandu'gor the Flayer, was one of the mighty C'tan star gods who ruled over the Necrontyr and helped with the biotransference that made them into Necrons. In the last days of the War in Heaven, the Necron forces turned on their C'tan masters. Most were shattered, rent into shards which were separated and individually imprisoned. However, it is said that only the C'tan known as Llandu'gor was utterly destroyed. Rumoured to have met annihilation at the hands of the Maynarkh Dynasty, on the order of the Silent King, the Flayer's last act was to curse the Necron race in his final moments of existence. This curse, one of the varieties of creeping madness which plague the waking Necrons, is referred to as the Flayer Virus, and is the cause of Necrons becoming the fell creatures known as the Flayed Ones. Those affected Necrons awaken with an unquenchable hunger for the warm flesh and blood of the living. ^^The return of Llandu'gor marks the end of all things, not just the Maynarkh Dynasty but all life, everywhere."

descr "Emberresh, the Suneater, Once held captive by the Xonthar Dynasty, who used it as a weapon against their enemies. Now only shards remain. Horrifying in appearance and immune to natural law. Each C'Tan is a master of the material realm just as the Chaos Gods are masters of the immaterium. The Suneater once consumed stars before gaining a taste for the life essence of mortals. For countless millennia it has slept along with its captors, now the shards are once more to be used as weapons and nothing can resist its insatiable hunger."

# suffer no damage or ill effects – instead they are immediately placed into Ongoing Reserves.
# TRANSPORT:
# • Transport Capacity: Fifteen models.

descr "The Night Scythe is the Necrons’ favoured tool of invasion, a sickle-winged herald of woe that possesses the ability to beam Necrons directly into battle. Manoeuvrable enough to evade orbital defences and interceptors, and swift enough to outpace mustering foes, Night Scythes can ghost through a defence perimeter to deploy invasion forces well behind enemy lines. Unlike the armoured carriers employed by other races, the Night Scythe does not have a transport compartment as such. Instead, it deploys troops by means of a captive wormhole, whose point of origin is anchored on a distant tomb world. Utilising technologies beyond the comprehension of the galaxy’s lesser races, these invasion beams allow the Night Scythe to fulfil the role of a conventional transport vehicle, yet without ever placing its ‘passengers’ at risk."

# SPECIAL RULES:

# Repair Barge: At the start of each friendly Movement phase, this model can repair fallen
# Necron Warriors. To do so, nominate a friendly unit of Necron Warriors that is either within
# 6" of this model or embarked upon it, and roll a D3. Add a number of Necron Warriors to the
# unit equal to the result – this cannot take the unit beyond its starting size nor, if it is
# currently embarked in the Ghost Ark, beyond the vehicle’s Transport Capacity (any excess are
# destroyed). These Necron Warriors must be placed within 6" of the Ghost Ark, or if the unit is
# currently embarked in the Ghost Ark, within it. If a model cannot be placed for any reason, it
# is destroyed. Necron Warriors repaired in this manner can move and act normally this turn.
# TRANSPORT:
# • Transport Capacity: Ten models. It can only carry Necron Warriors and Necron
# characters with the Infantry unit type.

Mindless feeding machines, the Scarabs are constructs designed to break down matter into raw energy that can then be woven into fresh forms. Within the confines of a tomb this process is one of clearing and manufacture, but on the battlefield it is a powerful force of destruction.

descr "The Destroyers’ chilling dedication to destruction is a valuable addition to any Necron army. They are deranged agents of annihilation whose sole reason for existence is centred around an unshakeable yearning to quench the flames of life. For a Destroyer, everything is subsumed into the all-important goal of extermination. They ruthlessly adapt, augment or expunge any facet of their physical form if it will improve their mission of slaughter. Legs are removed in favour of repulsor platforms, arms are fused to the workings of gauss cannons. Even the Destroyer’s senses are reconfigured to better serve target lock and prediction capability, its neural circuitry repathed to improve response times at the cost of vestigial emotions. A Destroyer draws no distinctions between combatants and civilians – all life is its enemy."

descr "Armed with oversized gauss cannons, Heavy Destroyers send blazing energy blasts searing across the battlefield. These heavily armed adherents of the Destroyer Cults glide across scorched earth scanning for victims, the flickering light of their weapons’ energy cores echoing the cold hatred in their optics. When a Heavy Destroyer’s targeting lens focuses upon an enemy, the battlefield recedes in its mind until only hunter and prey remain, the compulsion to kill drowning out everything else. Few things escape intact from the cold, unrelenting fury of a Heavy Destroyer once it has designated its target – even after its heavy gauss cannon has disabled a tank, the Destroyer will continue to hammer it with fire, tearing apart the twisted hull and incinerating crewmen even as they try to scramble free of the burning wreck."

# is within 6" of the Canoptek Spyder. Add a single Canoptek Scarab base to the unit – this can
# take the unit beyond its starting size, but must be placed within 6" of the Canoptek Spyder. If

# manner can move and act normally this turn. Roll a D6 each time a Canoptek Spyder uses its

# on a roll of a 1 the Canoptek Spyder suffers a single Wound with no saves of any
# kind allowed.

The unearthly howl of the Doom Scythes can scatter its foes, such is the terror it sows. Though shrewd Overlords will use this effect to their advantage, the greatest weapon in the Doom Scythe’s arsenal is its infamous death ray. Capable of ploughing a searing furrow through infantry, tanks and even towering bastions, these horrific weapons have given the Doom Scythe a dire reputation indeed."

Furthermore, its target matrices, motive units, power conduits and command nodes are all capable of comprehensive self-repair. So durable and deadly is the Monolith that it is most Overlords’ first choice to spearhead a full-scale planetary invasion. Drifting down from the heavens whilst spitting arcing blasts of particle energy, the Monolith brings death and destruction on a massive scale. Yet it is only when each Monolith’s eternity gate yawns wide and begins to disgorge rank upon rank of Necron soldiery that the enemy truly know despair."

descr "Transcendent C’tan are all that remain of the once mighty star-gods. They are echoes of their former selves, splinters of energy that survived the Necrons’ betrayal and were trammelled in tesseract labyrinths. Ancient, archaic technologies shackle these beings to the will of their Necron masters, compelling them to obey and reducing them to the merest echoes of their ancient majesty. Yet even in their reduced and fettered state, Transcendent C’tan are still beings of immense power: they can manifest energy blasts, control the minds of lesser beings, manipulate the flow of time, and banish foes to alternate realities. For all this, the C’tan are unwilling slaves and often pervert their masters’ wishes, slaying their foes by means which they see fit rather than to please their captors. The only hope of defeating a C’tan is to breach its necrodermis – the living shell that cages its raging essence and binds it to the material plane. Should the necrodermis’ integrity be compromised, the C’tan Shard implodes in a blinding pulse of energy, obliterating anything nearby."

descr "Only a race as ruthless and self-serving as the Necrons would think of unleashing a Tesseract Vault to further their aims – though each Vault is a potent weapon of war, the beings held within these floating prisons pose an almost incalculable threat. These Transcendent C’tan wield the coalescent power of so many shards that no mere tesseract labyrinth can hope to contain them – to allow such a being free rein is to invite destruction on a planetary scale. To counteract this threat, each Vault’s hull contains layers of node matrices that draw power from the Transcendent C’tan itself, leeching the energies of the god-fragment to maintain the very cage that holds it. Yet even so muzzled, the Transcendent C’tan has might enough to scatter armies to the winds, pervert the flow of time and space, and drag stars from the heavens."

# UNIT COMPOSITION:
# 1 Obelisk
# WARGEAR:
# • Four tesla spheres
# SPECIAL RULES:
# • Deep Strike
# • Living Meta
# Gravity Pulse: All enemy Flyer, Skimmer, Jetbike and Flying Monstrous Creature units
# treat all terrain within 18" of an Obelisk, including open ground, as dangerous terrain.
# Zooming Flyers and Swooping Monstrous Creatures must also take a Dangerous Terrain test
# if they move within 18" of an Obelisk, even though they do not normally take dangerous
# terrain tests.
# Sleeping Sentry: When you deploy an Obelisk, you can choose whether it is powered up or
# powered down. If it is powered up, it follows the normal rules for a vehicle of its type. If it is
# powered down, it may not move or shoot, but has a 3+ invulnerable save. You can choose to
# power up the Obelisk at the start of any of your Movement phases. An Obelisk that arrives by
# Deep Strike is automatically considered to be powered up. Once powered up, an Obelisk
# cannot power down later in the game.

setclassname	"Necrons"
classdescr "Long ago, the Necrons ruled the galaxy as its immortal overlords, before the march of time and the wounds of war forced them into hibernation. For millions of years their armies slumbered – endless ranks of deathless warriors held in stasis until the time when the Necrons would once again seek to dominate the stars. At long last, that time has come… ^^In the gathering twilight of the 41st Millennium, the Necrons are returning. Overlords and phaerons stride imperiously before silent ranks of death-masked warriors, their booming voices promising glorious battle in their long-forgotten tongue. Eldritch engines of war rise, propelled by arcing engines, while mechanical arachnids scuttle in their wake. World-ending weapons, the likes of which the galaxy has not seen for millions of years, stir to terrible life under the exacting attentions of Crypteks. Rank upon rank of skull-faced soldiers spill out from their tombs, like a tide of cold, hard steel. In their billions, the Necrons are rising up to reclaim what was once theirs, and the whole galaxy trembles at their coming. ^^The Necrons are a terror out of time, an ancient empire that existed millions of years before the Emperor forged the Imperium from Mankind’s warring worlds. Once, they were mortal creatures of flesh known as the Necrontyr – a short-lived and quarrelsome race, whose constant wars of conquest brought them to the very brink of annihilation. When faced with extinction, rather than fade meekly into oblivion the Necrontyr chose a devil’s bargain, surrendering their souls to the godlike C’tan so they might live on forever. Thus were born the Necrons – a blight upon the galaxy that would spread out to conquer in the name of the C’tan. During this long-dead age, the Necrons fought what would become known to some as the War in Heaven, scouring planets and entire systems of life. The metallic march of their legions echoed across countless battlefields – continents were shattered and even whole stars consumed under the advance of their seemingly invincible armies. The Necrons’ enemies fell in their untold billions before the relentless onslaught. ^^And yet, nothing endures forever. In time, even the greatest empires fracture and crumble. To stay the hand of entropy and escape the wrath of their gathering foes, the Necrons chose to enter an aeons-long slumber, reasoning that when they awoke the galaxy would once more be ripe for conquest. That time is now."
