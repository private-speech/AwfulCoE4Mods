Add immobile defense to every players home citadel to prevent early AI destruction by random wilderness riff-raff.  Code had to be radically changed as original COe3 did not work.    Added another crystal and Guardian from original.  Game may give AI  extra Guardian and crystal defenders, not sure why, but may be based on difficulty.  

Most early AI deaths now result in that class losing its only remaining commander.
Mod inspired by Ballbarian and updated for CoE4 by Stehmchip."
