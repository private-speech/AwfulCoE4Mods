Description: Adds thematic starting units & immobile defense to every players home citadel. This is an attempt to speed up the pace of the game and to improve weaker sides, such enchanter, markgraf, druid, and warlock. 
Every side gets something, but sides with very strong starts already (high priestess, necromancer) tend to get less. I don't claim that this is balanced in any way.
This is an extension of the mod Homeland Security, which was "inspired by Ballbarian and updated for CoE4 by Stehmchip."
