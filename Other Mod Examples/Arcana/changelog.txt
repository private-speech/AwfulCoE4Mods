-Entropy Magus buffed. Given new weapon: precombat fieldwide debuff. Given Planeshift ability. Vengeance increased (1->2). Armor taken away in place for ethereal.

-Lord Alchemist no longer has flat gold bonus. Now has up to flat 2/month gold and iron bonus up to max produced by current terrain. Retains old mine-based 200% bonus, but added same thing for iron.

-Lord Alchemist no longer generates rare items.

-7 new units. All are created through the use of the "Mage" unit. Rituals either convert or "exchange" the units for their counterpart. All have custom attacks of some kind.

-Balanced morale score in all units.
