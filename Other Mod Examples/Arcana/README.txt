	Hello and thanks for trying this mod!

A short description of how the faction works:

It's a faction of mages! The units are few and expensive, but elite.
The rituals are fairly useful and some are very powerful. They aren't
very heavy on the summoning side--it's important to use resources wisely.
Scouting is your friend: make use of scrying and arcane eyes. The faction 
revolves around the use of libraries: the more you have, the better. 
Libraries will decrease the cost of rituals by a large margin, and will
periodically cause mages to spawn in your libraries. Your alchemists help
you meet the demanding cost for many of your rituals if you manage to find
locations with high gold income and place them there (mines/cities/etc).

Thanks go to Marlin, I believe, as I made the custom sprites from the ones
he managed to get from Dominion and the previous CoE if I'm not mistaken.

Please email questions about the mod (bugs, advice, strategies, etc) to 
TylerKT@gmail.com, I'll do what I can to help fix anything. Fair warning,
the mod's not tested for compatability with many other mods but I haven't
had issues in the past. Best of luck.
