Map editing commands
You can create a map using only the map editor, but if you want to create something more complex like a scenario you will have to add some commands using a text editor. The maps save by the map editor are in text format and can be edited with a normal text editor.

The old CoE3 map editor manual is here;
http://jaffa.illwinter.com/coe3/manual_mapeditor.pdf

Maps in CoE4 works almost the same. Events use the new CoE4 event system instead and there are a few new commands as well.

The map commands for CoE4:
Commands generated by map editor
--------------------------------

mapsize <width> <height>

terrainrow <y> <terrain nbr 0> <terrain nbr 1> ...

groundrow <y> <ground nbr 0> <ground nbr 1> ...

temprow <y> <temperature nbr 0> <temperaure nbr 1> ...

squarename <x> <y> "name"
(Gives a name to s square that can be seen on the map. If name starts with "!1", it will be a background text instead. "!2" does the same, but the text will be larger. Values up to !9 can be used)



Additional commands that can only be added manually
---------------------------------------------------

mapdescr "text"

clusteredstart <value>

commoncause <value>

scoregraphs <value>

nostartcitadels

nocitynames
(Towns & ancient forests will not get any names automatically)

addfancyterrain
(This command should be used if you have created a map with only plains, forests and mountains on it. It will convert some plain into farms and towns, some mountains into hills and mines, some forests into jungles, ancient forests and swamps, etc.)

addsimpleterrain
(same as addfancyterrain, but no towns/cities/castles will be created)

playername <player> "name"

fixedstart <player> <x> <y>

fixedplayer <player> <class> <team> <controller> <ai level>



Events
------

Events can be added to the map file as well. See modding documentation for information on events.

Here is an example event that adds 2 trebuchets to player 0's home castle and also gives him 10 archers and 5 knights at location 30,33 on the map.
