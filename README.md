# AwfulCoE4Mods

This branch aspires to be a collection of resources for any prospective modders. 

The respective folders contain the following

Official documentation:

Collection of documents posted by Jonas (game developer) primarily in various threads on the Steam community forums for CoE4.

Other Files:

Various utilities and other things helpful for modding. Currently only contains CoE4 syntax files for notepad++

Other Mod Examples:

Collection of mods with (to the extent of my knowledge) permissive copyright. Intended to serve as a learning resource and inspiration for further mods. If your mod is featured and you are not happy with this, contact private-speech as per the note in the folder.

Database Files:

Dumps from the internal resource database. These are sourced from the Steam community forums as well, and have been acquired through hex editing by users. Illwinter has stated in the past that they are not against these files being made available, as is the case for their other titles like CoE3 and Dominions. Copyright as applicable belongs to Illwinter.
