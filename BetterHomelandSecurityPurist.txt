v.1.03

- Takes away most militia powers (still some left because it's really really useful for team games)
- Otherwise similar to v.1.03
v.1.06

This gives class-themed starting immobile units and commanders to everyone. They are not selectable for movement/transfer nor recruitable, making it easy not to confuse them with the real units. Sentry the defensive commander, he can't move or use rituals anyway. Same purpose as most similar mods, also has the effect that you have to both conquer the starting AI citadel [i]and[/i] kill all the commanders to win. Has several benefits including letting you contain enemies so you can play with the rest of the game or even farm them for charmed commanders, and making it even less likely that the AI gets killed by a pack of stray moose. Post any comments, suggestions, etc, here. Credit where it's due to the original authors of mods like these but honestly it's modding so whatever.

I've done the watered-down militia thing - the generic captains can now use two new rituals, one that adds 1d3 super crappy militia (like even worse than normal) to a settlement site at the cost of 1AP, and another one which adds tiny less crappy militia (actually a watered down version of the Baron militia in this case) for 1AP and 2 iron.
